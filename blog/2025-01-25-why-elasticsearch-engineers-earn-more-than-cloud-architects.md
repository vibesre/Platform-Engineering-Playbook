# Why Elasticsearch Engineers Earn $24K More Than Cloud Architects

**The data is in, and it's turning conventional wisdom on its head.**

If you're grinding through cloud certifications thinking it's your ticket to the top salary brackets, I've got news that might make you reconsider your entire learning roadmap.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

Here's what platform engineers are actually earning in 2025:

ü•á **Elasticsearch Engineers**: $139,549  
ü•à **Kafka Specialists**: $136,526  
ü•â **Redis Experts**: $136,357

...

üò¨ **Azure Architects**: $115,304  
üò± **GCP Engineers**: $111,204

That's right. The "must-have" cloud platforms are being outearned by specialized tools by over $24,000 per year.

## What Changed?

Remember 2020? Everyone was rushing to get cloud certified. AWS Solutions Architect was _the_ certification. Companies couldn't hire cloud engineers fast enough.

Fast forward to 2025:

- **93% of companies** use Kubernetes
- **Every developer** knows Docker basics
- **Cloud platforms** have become... ordinary

When everyone has the same skills, those skills stop commanding premium salaries. It's Economics 101, and it's happening right now in platform engineering.

## The Complete Platform Engineering Salary Tier List

Think of platform engineering skills like a video game tier list. You wouldn't main a C-tier character if you're trying to rank up, right?

## The Skills That Are Dying

Watch out - these are losing value fast:

| ‚ö†Ô∏è Skill           | Salary Change | Why It's Declining     |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| **NoSQL**          | -7%           | Too generic            |
| **PAAS**           | -6%           | Abstracted away        |
| **SOAP**           | -6%           | REST won               |

| **Git**            | -3%           | Complete commodity     |

## Three Costly Career Mistakes

### Mistake #1: The Certification Collector

"I have 15 cloud certifications!"

**Reality check**: Depth beats breadth

- 5 AWS certs: ~$120k
- Deep Elasticsearch expertise: $139k
- **Difference**: $19k/year lost

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Market Signals

These skills are commoditizing NOW:

- **Kubernetes**: 93% adoption, -1% salary
- **Docker**: Everyone knows it, -2% salary
- **Git**: Universal skill, -3% salary

**Action**: Move up the stack to specialization

### Mistake #3: Platform-Only Focus

Pure platform engineers plateau at $140k. Add:

- **+ Go programming**: $150k+
- **+ Data engineering**: $155k+
- **+ ML/AI integration**: $160k+
- **+ Security expertise**: $165k+

## Your 90-Day Action Plan

### Days 1-30: Assessment & Planning

- [ ] Audit current skills against tier list
- [ ] Identify 2-3 S-tier targets
- [ ] Pick specialization path
- [ ] Set up learning environment

### Days 31-60: Foundation Building

- [ ] Complete one certification in target area
- [ ] Build first project with S-tier tool
- [ ] Contribute to open source
- [ ] Join tool-specific communities

### Days 61-90: Market Positioning

- [ ] Update LinkedIn with new skills
- [ ] Write 3 blog posts about learnings
- [ ] Present at local meetup
- [ ] Apply to roles requiring specialization

## The Uncomfortable Truth

**The generalist era is over.**

While you're collecting cloud certifications, specialists are:

- Solving harder problems
- Building deeper expertise
- Commanding higher salaries
- Becoming irreplaceable

The market has spoken clearly: **Elasticsearch beats Azure by $24,245/year**.

## Your Next Move

1. **Accept reality**: Cloud platforms are commoditized
2. **Pick your tier**: Where you are vs. where you want to be
3. **Choose specialization**: Based on interest AND market data
4. **Start today**: Even 30 minutes daily compounds

The gap between B-tier and S-tier isn't just salary‚Äîit's career trajectory, job security, and professional satisfaction.

**The tier list is clear. The path is defined. The only question is: which tier will you choose?**
