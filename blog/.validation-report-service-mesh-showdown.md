## HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (Must Fix)

### 1. ❌ 56% Throughput Claim - Confusing Presentation

**Location**: Lines 231-233, Statistics Table Row

**Current Text**:
> **Difference**: Istio delivered **+56% more queries** (363 additional queries per core)

**Problem**: The text conflates two distinct metrics:
- **Queries per core**: 2,178 vs 1,815 = 20% improvement ✅
- **Total cluster throughput**: 56% more (under specific load conditions) ✅

The math `363 / 1,815 = 20%`, NOT 56%. The statement "(363 additional queries per core)" implies the 56% is a per-core metric, which is incorrect.

**Source Verification**:
- Istio.io states: "Istio was able to deliver 56% more queries at 20% lower tail latency" (total throughput)
- Istio.io states: "2178 Queries Per Core, vs Cilium's 1815, a 20% improvement" (per-core efficiency)

**Fix Required**:
```markdown
**Throughput Results**:

- **Istio Ambient**: 2,178 queries per core
- **Cilium**: 1,815 queries per core
- **Per-Core Efficiency**: Istio delivered **+20% more** (363 additional queries per core)
- **Total Cluster Throughput**: Istio delivered **+56% more queries** in enterprise-scale tests

At 11,000 cores, the 20% per-core advantage translates to 3,993,000 additional queries per second cluster-wide capacity (2,178 × 11,000 = 23.96M vs 1,815 × 11,000 = 19.97M).
```

**Also Fix Statistics Table** (Line 69):
- Change: `**Throughput vs Cilium** | - | **+56% more** | Baseline`
- To: `**Total Throughput Advantage** | - | **+56% more** | Baseline | - | [Istio.io]`
- Add: `**Per-Core Efficiency** | - | **+20% more** | Baseline | - | [Istio.io]`

### 2. ⚠️ 85% Memory Reduction - Unsourced Claim

**Locations**:
- Line 23 (FAQ answer)
- Line 55 (Quick Answer)
- Line 209 (Benchmark section)

**Current Claims**:
> "85% less memory than sidecar"
> "academic benchmarks show Ambient uses 85% less memory than traditional Istio at 3,200 RPS"

**Problem**: The 85% figure does NOT appear in the ArXiv academic study (verified via WebFetch).

**Actual Data from ArXiv**:
- Istio Sidecar: +424MB per connection pair (255MB client + 169MB server)
- Istio Ambient: +26MB per node (intra-node) or +86MB per node (inter-node)

**Correct Calculations**:
- Intra-node comparison: (424 - 26) / 424 = **94% reduction**
- Inter-node comparison: (424 - 86) / 424 = **80% reduction**
- Per-pod vs per-node at scale (500 pods, 50 nodes): (500×250MB - 50×26MB) / (500×250MB) = **99% reduction**

**Fix Required**:
Change "85%" to either:
- **"80-94% less memory"** (range from ArXiv data)
- **"26MB per node vs 424MB per connection pair"** (specific numbers without percentage)
- Remove the claim entirely if no source can be found

**Recommendation**: Use "Ambient uses 26MB per node versus 250MB per pod for sidecars—eliminating per-pod memory overhead" (factual, no percentage needed).

## MEDIUM PRIORITY (Clarify)

### 3. ⚠️ Quote Attribution Needs Context

**Location**: Lines 245-246

**Current Text**:
> As Istio's official benchmark report stated: "Istio was able to deliver 56% more queries at 20% lower tail latency" in the enterprise-scale comparison.

**Issue**: This quote is accurate BUT immediately follows text about "per-core" metrics, which may confuse readers into thinking 56% is per-core (it's not—it's total cluster throughput).

**Fix**: Add clarifying sentence:
> As Istio's official benchmark report stated: "Istio was able to deliver 56% more queries at 20% lower tail latency." **This 56% advantage reflects total cluster throughput under load, while the 20% per-core metric shows resource-normalized efficiency.**

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### MUST FIX (Before Publication)

1. **Fix 56% vs 20% confusion** (Lines 231-233, table row 69)
   - Clarify 56% = total throughput, 20% = per-core efficiency
   - Add explanatory sentence distinguishing the two metrics

2. **Fix or remove 85% memory claim** (Lines 23, 55, 209)
   - Change to "80-94%" if using ArXiv range
   - OR use specific numbers "26MB/node vs 424MB/connection"
   - OR remove percentage entirely

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Recommended)

3. **Add context to 56% quote** (Line 245)
   - Insert: "This 56% advantage reflects total cluster throughput under load..."

4. **Consider adding WireGuard source**
   - While accurate, the specific service mesh page didn't mention WireGuard
   - Link to Cilium encryption docs if available

### OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS

5. **Consistency check**: Some sections say "per-pod" vs "per connection" for sidecar memory
   - ArXiv data is "per connection" (client + server)
   - Clarify: 250MB is per-pod sidecar, 424MB is for client-server pair

6. **Link validation**: Consider adding archive.org links for critical sources to prevent future 404s
