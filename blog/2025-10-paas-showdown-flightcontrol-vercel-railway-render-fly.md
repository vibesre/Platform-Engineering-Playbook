# PaaS Showdown 2025: When Does AWS Abstraction Make Sense?

You're paying $1,200/month for Vercel. Your AWS bill would be $300 for the same workload. But managing that infrastructure yourself means hiring a DevOps engineer at $150K/year. The math keeps changing, and nobody's showing you the real numbers.

Welcome to the 2025 PaaS landscape, where the [AWS](/technical/aws) complexity tax has spawned an entire industry of abstraction layers—each promising Heroku-like simplicity with cloud-scale performance. But which one actually delivers?

This isn't another feature checklist. We've analyzed pricing models, tested deployment workflows, and talked to teams running production workloads on each platform. Here's what you actually need to know.

> 🎙️ **Listen to the podcast episode**: [PaaS Showdown 2025: Flightcontrol vs Vercel vs Railway vs Render vs Fly.io](/podcasts/00004-paas-showdown) - A deep dive conversation exploring these platforms with real-world pricing examples and decision frameworks.

## Quick Answer (TL;DR)

**Problem**: [AWS](/technical/aws) offers unmatched scale and pricing, but managing it requires dedicated DevOps expertise. Simplified PaaS platforms charge 3-5x markups for convenience.

**Solution**: New-generation PaaS platforms offer different trade-offs:
- **Flightcontrol**: AWS infra in your account, managed interface ($97-397/month + AWS costs)
- **Vercel**: Premium DX and edge performance, premium pricing (Free to $3,500+/month)
- **Railway**: Usage-based pricing, excellent DX ($5-20+/month minimum)
- **Render**: Transparent pricing, solid features ($0-29/month + compute)
- **Fly.io**: Global edge deployment, technical control (pay-per-second)

**ROI**: The break-even point varies by team size and workload, but generally:
- Under 5 engineers: Use Railway or Render's free/hobby tiers
- 5-15 engineers: Fly.io or Flightcontrol depending on AWS preference
- 15+ engineers: Flightcontrol or self-managed with [infrastructure as code](/technical/terraform)

**Timeline**: Platform migration typically takes 2-4 weeks; ROI realized in 3-6 months

**Key Decision**: Do you value developer velocity over infrastructure control? That's the real question.

## Key Statistics (2024-2025 Data)

| Break-even point for Flightcontrol vs Vercel | 50-100GB monthly bandwidth | Cost analysis, 2025 |

## The AWS Complexity Tax Is Real

Here's what managing AWS infrastructure actually costs:

A mid-sized team (10-20 engineers) running typical web applications needs:
- VPC configuration and security groups
- Load balancers and auto-scaling
- RDS or managed databases
- S3 buckets with proper IAM policies
- CloudFront CDN setup
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Disaster recovery plans

Doing this properly requires 1-2 dedicated DevOps engineers ($150-200K each) or significant time from your existing team. Even with infrastructure-as-code tools like [Terraform](/technical/terraform), you're looking at hundreds of hours of initial setup and ongoing maintenance.

The 2024 Platform Engineering survey found that teams spend an average of 30% of their infrastructure time just maintaining deployment pipelines and dealing with AWS complexity ([Platform Engineering State of the Union, 2024](https://platformengineering.org/state-of-platform-engineering-2024)).

> **💡 Key Takeaway**
>
> The real cost of AWS isn't the infrastructure bill—it's the engineering time spent managing it. PaaS platforms trade money for time, but that trade-off isn't always worth it.

## The Build vs Buy Equation

The real question isn't just "which PaaS?" but "should we use PaaS at all?"

### When to Build Your Own (Terraform/Pulumi):

**Break-even point**: ~3-5 dedicated platform engineers

**Good reasons to build**:
- Team >30 engineers with dedicated platform team
- Very specific compliance or security requirements
- Heavy AWS-specific service usage (SageMaker, EMR, etc.)
- Cost optimization is critical ($10K+ monthly AWS bills)
- Infrastructure itself is competitive advantage

**Total cost including labor**:
```
Year 1:
- 2 platform engineers: $300K (salary + benefits)
- AWS infrastructure: $120K
- Terraform/IaC tooling: $10K
- Total: $430K/year

PaaS alternative (Flightcontrol for 30 engineers):
- Platform fee: $4,764/year ($397/month)
- AWS costs: $120K/year
- Total: $124,764/year

Self-managed costs 3.4x more year one
```

But this changes over time as your infrastructure stabilizes and the learning curve flattens.

> **💡 Key Takeaway**
>
> Unless you have 30+ engineers or very specific requirements, PaaS platforms provide better ROI than building. The engineering time saved compounds into faster feature delivery.

## Hidden Costs to Watch

### Flightcontrol
- Preview environments count as services ($20-30 each beyond included)

- Support is community-only on free tier

### Vercel
- Bandwidth charges scale aggressively
- Image optimization bills separately
- Enterprise tier has steep minimum ($20-25K/year)
- Function execution time adds up quickly

### Railway
- $20/month Pro minimum even if you use $2 of resources
- Egress at $0.05/GB (10x more than AWS egress)
- No free tier (only 30-day trial)

### Render
- Free tier services spin down (30-minute cold starts)
- Bandwidth limits are strict (100GB hobby, 500GB pro)
- Limited regions (higher latency for global users)

### Fly.io
- Bandwidth costs vary widely by region ($0.02-0.12/GB)
- Steeper learning curve means more time investment
- Fewer managed services (DIY Redis, queues, etc.)

## Migration Strategy: Moving Between Platforms

**Complexity**: Medium (need to adapt to AWS services)

**Steps**:
1. Map Vercel features to AWS equivalents (Edge Functions → Lambda@Edge)
2. Set up Flightcontrol project and link AWS account
3. Migrate environment variables and secrets
4. Set up databases in RDS (migrate data)
5. Test in preview environment
6. Switch DNS, monitor

**Gotchas**: Vercel's Edge Runtime doesn't directly map to AWS Lambda@Edge

### Railway ← Heroku
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Complexity**: Low (very similar models)

**Steps**:
1. Export Heroku database (pg_dump)
2. Create Railway services matching Heroku apps
3. Import database to Railway Postgres
4. Migrate environment variables
5. Deploy from same Git repo
6. Switch DNS

**Gotchas**: Heroku add-ons need equivalent Railway services or external SaaS

### Fly.io ← Any Platform
**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks
**Complexity**: Medium-High (requires Docker knowledge)

**Steps**:
1. Dockerize your application (if not already)
2. Create fly.toml configuration
3. Deploy to staging regions first
4. Set up Fly Postgres and migrate data
5. Configure secrets and environment
6. Deploy globally, test latency
7. Switch DNS region by region

**Gotchas**: Fly.io is more hands-on; expect to debug infrastructure issues

### 📚 Infrastructure as Code Alternatives

If you're considering building your own:

- [Terraform AWS Examples](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-examples) - Production-ready modules (15K+ ⭐)
- [Pulumi Examples](https://github.com/pulumi/examples) - Multi-cloud infrastructure code (2.3K+ ⭐)
- [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html) - Cloud Development Kit for TypeScript/Python
- [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) - If going container orchestration route

## Conclusion: There's No Universal Answer

The "best" PaaS depends entirely on your context:

**You're a solo developer**: Use Render's free tier or Railway hobby. Don't overthink it.

**You're a 5-person startup**: Railway or Render Professional offer the best DX-to-cost ratio. Avoid enterprise platforms.

**You're scaling to 20+ engineers**: Flightcontrol starts making economic sense. Compare carefully against self-managed AWS with IaC.

**You're frontend-focused on Next.js**: Vercel's DX is genuinely exceptional. Budget accordingly or use hobby tier.

**You need global edge deployment**: Fly.io offers the best price-performance for distributed workloads.

**You're deeply invested in AWS**: Flightcontrol is probably your answer. You keep control while gaining simplicity.

The platforms are converging on features but diverging on pricing models and target audiences. The key is matching your team's size, technical expertise, and budget constraints to the right trade-off.

And remember: you can always change your mind. The platforms listed here make migration relatively straightforward. Start with simplicity, scale to control as needed.
