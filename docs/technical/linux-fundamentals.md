## üéØ Key Concepts to Master

### File System & Navigation
- Directory structure (`/`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/home`, `/usr`)
- File permissions and ownership
- Hard links vs soft links
- Special files (`/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`)

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Navigation
ls, cd, pwd, find, locate, which

# File Operations  
cp, mv, rm, mkdir, touch, chmod, chown

# Text Processing
cat, less, grep, sed, awk, cut, sort

# System Information
ps, top, htop, df, du, free, uname

# Network
ip, netstat, ss, ping, traceroute, dig

# Package Management
apt/yum/dnf, dpkg/rpm, snap
```

### Process Management
- Process states and lifecycle
- Signals (SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGHUP)
- Background jobs (`&`, `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`)
- Process priorities and nice values
- systemd vs init

### Users & Permissions
- User and group management
- File permissions (rwx, octal notation)
- Special permissions (setuid, setgid, sticky bit)
- sudo and su
- PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)

### Shell Fundamentals
- Shell types (bash, zsh, sh)
- Environment variables
- Shell expansion and globbing
- Pipes and redirection
- Job control

## üí° Interview Tips

### Common Interview Questions
1. **Explain the boot process of Linux**
   - BIOS/UEFI ‚Üí Bootloader ‚Üí Kernel ‚Üí Init/systemd ‚Üí Runlevel/Target

2. **What happens when you type `ls` in the terminal?**
   - Shell interprets command ‚Üí fork() ‚Üí exec() ‚Üí system calls ‚Üí output

3. **Explain file permissions and how to change them**
   - Read/Write/Execute for User/Group/Others
   - chmod with symbolic (u+x) or octal (755) notation

4. **How do you find which process is using a specific port?**
   - `netstat -tulpn | grep :PORT` or `ss -tulpn | grep :PORT`
   - `lsof -i :PORT`

5. **Explain the difference between hard and soft links**
   - Hard links: same inode, can't cross filesystems
   - Soft links: different inode, can cross filesystems, can break

### Practical Scenarios
- "Debug why a service won't start"
- "Find and fix disk space issues"
- "Troubleshoot high CPU usage"
- "Set up automated log rotation"
- "Secure a Linux server"
