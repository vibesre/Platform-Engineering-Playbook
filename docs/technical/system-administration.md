# Linux System Administration

Linux system administration forms the backbone of modern platform engineering. As organizations increasingly rely on Linux-based infrastructure, platform engineers must possess deep expertise in managing, securing, and optimizing Linux systems. This comprehensive guide covers essential system administration skills that every platform engineer needs to effectively manage production environments, troubleshoot issues, and maintain system reliability.

## Core Concepts and Features

### System Architecture
Linux follows a modular architecture with distinct layers:
- **Kernel**: Core system managing hardware resources
- **Shell**: Command-line interface for user interaction
- **System Libraries**: Shared code used by applications
- **System Utilities**: Essential tools for system management
- **User Applications**: Software running on the system

### Key Administrative Domains
1. **User and Group Management**
   - Creating and managing user accounts
   - Setting permissions and access controls
   - Managing sudo privileges
   - Implementing user quotas

2. **Process Management**
   - Understanding process lifecycle
   - Managing system services
   - Process prioritization and resource limits
   - Signal handling and process communication

3. **File System Management**
   - Partition management and formatting
   - Mount points and fstab configuration
   - File permissions and ownership
   - Special permissions (SUID, SGID, sticky bit)

4. **System Monitoring**
   - Resource utilization tracking
   - Log file analysis
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Alerting and notification systems

5. **Package Management**
   - Installing and updating software
   - Dependency resolution
   - Repository management
   - Building from source

## Common Use Cases

### Infrastructure Automation
Platform engineers use Linux administration skills to:
- Automate server provisioning
- Implement configuration management
- Deploy applications consistently
- Manage infrastructure as code

### Security Hardening
- Implementing access controls
- Configuring firewalls and SELinux
- Managing SSL certificates
- Auditing system security

### Performance Optimization
- Tuning kernel parameters
- Optimizing disk I/O
- Managing memory usage
- Network performance tuning

### Disaster Recovery
- Implementing backup strategies
- Creating system snapshots
- Planning failover procedures
- Testing recovery processes

## Getting Started Example

Here's a practical example of setting up a new Linux server for production use:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Initial server setup script

# Update system packages
echo "Updating system packages..."
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# Create admin user
echo "Creating admin user..."
useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G sudo adminuser
echo "adminuser:$(openssl rand -base64 32)" | chpasswd

# Configure SSH
echo "Configuring SSH..."
sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sed -i 's/#PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
systemctl restart sshd

# Set up firewall
echo "Configuring firewall..."
ufw default deny incoming
ufw default allow outgoing
ufw allow 22/tcp
ufw allow 80/tcp
ufw allow 443/tcp
ufw --force enable

# Install essential tools
echo "Installing essential tools..."
apt install -y \
    htop \
    vim \
    git \
    curl \
    wget \
    net-tools \
    build-essential \
    software-properties-common

# Configure automatic updates
echo "Setting up automatic security updates..."
apt install -y unattended-upgrades
dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades

# Set up system monitoring
echo "Installing monitoring tools..."
apt install -y prometheus-node-exporter
systemctl enable prometheus-node-exporter
systemctl start prometheus-node-exporter

# Configure log rotation
cat > /etc/logrotate.d/custom-apps << EOF
/var/log/custom-app/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 7
    compress
    delaycompress
    missingok
    notifempty
    create 0640 www-data adm
}
EOF

echo "Initial setup complete!"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Security First
- Always use SSH keys instead of passwords
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Regularly update and patch systems
- Enable and configure firewalls
- Use SELinux or AppArmor when possible

### 2. Documentation and Change Management
```bash
# Document system changes
echo "$(date): Installed nginx version $(nginx -v 2>&1)" >> /var/log/system-changes.log

# Use configuration management tools
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml --check  # Dry run
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml          # Apply changes
```

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting
```bash
# Set up basic monitoring
cat > /usr/local/bin/system-health-check.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# System health check script

# Check disk usage
df -h | awk '$5 > 80 {print "Warning: " $6 " is " $5 " full"}'

# Check memory usage
free -m | awk 'NR==2{printf "Memory Usage: %.2f%%\n", $3*100/$2}'

# Check load average
uptime | awk '{print "Load Average: " $(NF-2) $(NF-1) $NF}'

# Check for failed services
systemctl list-units --failed
EOF

chmod +x /usr/local/bin/system-health-check.sh
```

### 4. Backup and Recovery
```bash
# Automated backup script
cat > /usr/local/bin/daily-backup.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_DIR="/backup/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Backup system configuration
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/etc-backup.tar.gz" /etc/

# Backup user data
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/home-backup.tar.gz" /home/

# Backup database
mysqldump --all-databases > "$BACKUP_DIR/mysql-backup.sql"

# Rotate old backups
find /backup -type d -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} +
EOF

# Schedule backup
echo "0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/daily-backup.sh" | crontab -
```

## Common Commands and Operations

### User Management
```bash
# Create user with specific UID and home directory
useradd -u 1001 -m -d /home/devuser -s /bin/bash devuser

# Modify user properties
usermod -aG docker,sudo devuser

# Set password expiry
chage -M 90 -W 14 devuser

# Lock/unlock user account
passwd -l username  # Lock
passwd -u username  # Unlock

# View user information
id devuser
groups devuser
finger devuser
```

### Process Management
```bash
# View processes

pstree -p
top -b -n 1

# Manage processes
kill -15 1234      # Graceful termination

killall nginx      # Kill by name

# Process priorities
nice -n 10 long-running-command
renice -n 5 -p 1234

# Resource limits

chown user:group file.txt
setfacl -m u:user:rwx file

# Find operations
