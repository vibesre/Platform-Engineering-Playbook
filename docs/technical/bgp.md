# BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

## Introduction

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing information between autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. It's often called the "routing protocol of the Internet" as it's responsible for making core routing decisions. BGP is a path vector protocol that makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, and rule sets.

### Key Features
- Path vector routing protocol
- Policy-based routing decisions
- Loop prevention mechanisms
- Support for IPv4 and IPv6
- Scalability for Internet-scale routing
- Multi-protocol extensions (MP-BGP)
- Route aggregation and summarization
- Communities for route tagging

## Core Concepts

### 1. **BGP Fundamentals**
- **Autonomous System (AS)**: Collection of IP networks under single administrative control
- **AS Number (ASN)**: Unique identifier for an AS (16-bit or 32-bit)
- **EBGP**: External BGP between different AS
- **IBGP**: Internal BGP within the same AS
- **BGP Peers/Neighbors**: Routers that exchange BGP information

### 2. **BGP Message Types**
- **OPEN**: Establish BGP session
- **UPDATE**: Exchange routing information
- **KEEPALIVE**: Maintain session
- **NOTIFICATION**: Report errors
- **ROUTE-REFRESH**: Request route updates

### 3. **BGP Attributes**
- **ORIGIN**: Source of the route (IGP, EGP, Incomplete)
- **AS_PATH**: List of AS traversed
- **NEXT_HOP**: Next router to reach destination
- **MED**: Multi-Exit Discriminator for path preference
- **LOCAL_PREF**: Preference within an AS
- **COMMUNITY**: Route tagging for policies
- **WEIGHT**: Cisco-specific local preference

### 4. **BGP Path Selection**
1. Highest WEIGHT (Cisco only)
2. Highest LOCAL_PREF
3. Locally originated routes
4. Shortest AS_PATH
5. Lowest ORIGIN type
6. Lowest MED
7. EBGP over IBGP
8. Lowest IGP metric to NEXT_HOP
9. Oldest route
10. Lowest Router ID
11. Lowest neighbor IP

## Common Use Cases

### 1. **Internet Service Provider (ISP) Peering**
```bash
# Cisco IOS Configuration

 ! EBGP Peering with Upstream ISP

ip as-path access-list 1 deny _65666_
ip as-path access-list 1 permit .*
neighbor 192.0.2.1 filter-list 1 in

! 6. Enable GTSM (TTL Security)

## Interview Questions

### Basic Level
1. **Q: What is BGP and why is it important?**
   A: BGP is the Border Gateway Protocol, the routing protocol used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems on the Internet. It's important because it enables global Internet connectivity by allowing different networks to share reachability information.

2. **Q: Explain the difference between EBGP and IBGP.**
   A: EBGP (External BGP) is used between different autonomous systems with different AS numbers, while IBGP (Internal BGP) is used within the same autonomous system. EBGP changes the next-hop attribute and has an administrative distance of 20, while IBGP preserves the next-hop and has an administrative distance of 200.

3. **Q: What are BGP attributes and name the well-known mandatory attributes?**
   A: BGP attributes are characteristics attached to BGP routes that help in path selection. Well-known mandatory attributes that must be present in all BGP updates are: ORIGIN (source of the route), AS_PATH (list of AS numbers), and NEXT_HOP (next router to reach the destination).

### Intermediate Level
4. **Q: Explain the BGP path selection process.**
   A: BGP selects the best path based on: 1) Highest WEIGHT (Cisco), 2) Highest LOCAL_PREF, 3) Locally originated routes, 4) Shortest AS_PATH, 5) Lowest ORIGIN type, 6) Lowest MED, 7) EBGP over IBGP, 8) Lowest IGP metric to NEXT_HOP, 9) Oldest route, 10) Lowest Router ID, 11) Lowest neighbor IP.

5. **Q: What is BGP route reflection and why is it needed?**
   A: Route reflection is a method to reduce the number of IBGP sessions in large networks. It's needed because IBGP requires full mesh connectivity (every router must peer with every other router), which doesn't scale well. Route reflectors can reflect routes learned from one IBGP peer to other IBGP peers.

6. **Q: How do BGP communities work and what are they used for?**
   A: BGP communities are optional transitive attributes that tag routes for implementing routing policies. They're 32-bit values (typically written as ASN:value) used for marking routes to control routing decisions, implement customer policies, or signal specific handling requirements across AS boundaries.

### Advanced Level
7. **Q: How would you design a BGP architecture for a multi-homed enterprise?**
   A: Design considerations include: Use different AS paths for load balancing, implement proper inbound/outbound policies, use local preference for outbound traffic control, use AS-PATH prepending or MED for inbound control, filter bogon prefixes, implement prefix limits, use BGP communities for policy signaling, enable BFD for fast failover, and implement proper redundancy with multiple edge routers.

8. **Q: Explain BGP convergence issues and optimization techniques.**
   A: BGP convergence can be slow due to default timers (30s keepalive, 180s hold). Optimization techniques include: BGP fast external failover, tuning timers, using BFD for fast failure detection, BGP PIC (Prefix Independent Convergence), BGP Add-Path for backup path pre-computation, next-hop tracking, and update group optimization.

9. **Q: How do you troubleshoot BGP peering issues?**
   A: Systematic approach: Verify Layer 1/2/3 connectivity, check BGP configuration (AS numbers, peer IPs), verify TCP port 179 connectivity, check authentication, review ACLs/firewalls, verify TTL settings (multihop), check for maximum prefix violations, review route policies and filters, analyze BGP state machine and logs, and use packet captures if necessary.

### Scenario-Based
10. **Q: Design a BGP solution for a service provider network with requirements for customer segregation, DDoS mitigation, and traffic engineering.**
    A: Implement MP-BGP with VRFs for customer segregation, use BGP FlowSpec for DDoS mitigation, implement RTBH (Remote Triggered Black Hole) with communities, use BGP communities for traffic engineering, implement proper filtering at customer edges, use route servers at IXPs, implement BGP security measures (RPKI, filters), and design redundant route reflector architecture for scalability.
