# Cloud Platforms & Services

<GitHubButtons />
Welcome to the Cloud Platforms & Services section of the Platform Engineering Playbook. This section covers the major cloud providers and related services that platform engineers work with daily.

## üìã What You'll Find Here

### Major Cloud Providers
- **[AWS](./aws)** - Amazon Web Services, the market leader in cloud computing
- **[Azure](./azure)** - Microsoft's cloud platform with strong enterprise integration
- **[Google Cloud Platform](./gcp)** - Google's cloud offering with strengths in data and AI

### Cloud Services & Concepts
- **[IAM](./iam)** - Identity and Access Management across cloud platforms
- **[Serverless](./serverless)** - Function-as-a-Service and serverless architectures
- **[API Gateway](./api-gateway)** - Managing and securing APIs at scale

### Private & Hybrid Cloud
- **[OpenStack](./openstack)** - Open source cloud computing platform
- **[VMware](./vmware)** - Enterprise virtualization and private cloud solutions

## üéØ Getting Started

If you're new to cloud platforms, here's a suggested learning path:

1. **Start with one major cloud provider** - AWS has the largest market share, but choose based on your organization's needs
2. **Master IAM concepts** - Security and access control are fundamental across all platforms
3. **Explore serverless** - Understanding FaaS helps you build modern, scalable applications
4. **Learn infrastructure patterns** - API gateways, load balancers, and networking basics

## üîë Key Skills for Platform Engineers

- **Multi-cloud strategy** - Understanding strengths and trade-offs of different providers
- **Cost optimization** - Managing cloud spend effectively
- **Security best practices** - IAM, network security, and compliance
- **Automation** - Using cloud APIs and Infrastructure as Code
- **Architecture patterns** - Designing for scalability, reliability, and performance
