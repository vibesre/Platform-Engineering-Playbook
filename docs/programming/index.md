# Programming for Platform Engineers

Master the programming skills essential for platform engineering, from scripting and automation to building robust platform tools and services.

## Core Programming Languages

### Python
- Automation and scripting
- Infrastructure as Code tools (Boto3, Terraform CDK)
- Data processing and analysis
- Building CLI tools

### Go
- Cloud-native application development
- Kubernetes operators and controllers
- High-performance system tools
- Concurrent programming patterns

### Shell Scripting
- Bash scripting best practices
- System administration tasks
- CI/CD pipeline scripts
- One-liners for common tasks

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Frontend dashboards and monitoring UIs
- Node.js for backend services
- Serverless functions
- API development

## Platform Engineering Patterns

### Infrastructure as Code
- Declarative vs imperative approaches
- Terraform modules and best practices
- CloudFormation and CDK patterns
- GitOps workflows

### API Development
- RESTful API design
- GraphQL for platform services
- gRPC for microservices
- API versioning strategies

### Automation Frameworks
- Ansible playbook development
- Python automation libraries
- Task orchestration with Airflow
- Custom operator development

## Software Engineering Practices

### Code Quality
- Testing strategies (unit, integration, e2e)
- Code review best practices
- Static analysis and linting
- Documentation standards

### Version Control
- Git workflows for infrastructure code
- Branch protection and policies
- Monorepo vs polyrepo strategies
- Semantic versioning

### CI/CD Implementation
- Pipeline as code
- Automated testing strategies
- Deployment automation
- Rollback mechanisms

## Building Platform Tools

### CLI Development
- Command-line interface design
- Argument parsing and validation
- Interactive prompts
- Distribution and packaging

### Monitoring & Observability Tools
- Metrics collection agents
- Log aggregation tools
- Custom Prometheus exporters
- Tracing instrumentation

### Internal Developer Platforms
- Self-service portals
- Service catalogs
- Developer experience tools
- Platform abstractions

## Interview Coding Challenges

Common coding scenarios:
- Implement a rate limiter
- Build a simple load balancer
- Create a log parser
- Design a configuration management system
