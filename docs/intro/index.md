# Platform Engineering Playbook

Your focused guide to acing platform engineering, SRE, and DevOps interviews.

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Guide Covers

This guide is laser-focused on helping you succeed in platform engineering interviews at top tech companies. We cover:

- **Technical skills** you need to demonstrate
- **System design** for infrastructure and platforms
- **Programming challenges** specific to platform engineering
- **Behavioral questions** and how to answer them
- **Hands-on labs** to build real experience

## ðŸ“š Guide Structure

### 1. **[Core Technical Skills](/core-technical)**
Master the fundamentals every platform engineer needs:
- Linux systems and internals
- Networking essentials
- Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Containers and Kubernetes
- Infrastructure as Code
- Security fundamentals

### 2. **[Platform Infrastructure](/platform-infrastructure)**
Build and scale the platforms that power modern applications:
- Distributed systems principles
- Data storage and databases
- Message queues and streaming
- Service mesh architecture
- API gateways and management
- CI/CD platforms

### 3. **[Reliability & Operations](/reliability-operations)**
Keep systems running at scale:
- Monitoring and observability
- SRE practices and SLOs
- Incident management
- Chaos engineering
- Performance and scaling

### 4. **[System Design](/system-design)**
Design large-scale infrastructure systems:
- Design principles and patterns
- Common interview problems
- Practice scenarios with solutions

### 5. **[Programming Skills](/programming)**
Code like a platform engineer:
- Python for automation
- Go for infrastructure tools
- Bash scripting mastery
- Platform-specific coding challenges

### 6. **[Interview Skills](/interview-prep)**
Ace the non-technical aspects:
- Behavioral question strategies
- Technical communication
- Interview process navigation
- Resume optimization

### 7. **[Hands-On Labs](/hands-on-labs)**
Build real projects:
- CI/CD pipeline from scratch
- Kubernetes cluster deployment
- Monitoring stack implementation
- Disaster recovery simulation

## ðŸŽ“ What is Platform Engineering?

Platform Engineering is the discipline of building and operating self-service internal developer platforms. Platform engineers:

- **Build** infrastructure abstractions and tools
- **Automate** operational tasks at scale
- **Enable** developer productivity and velocity
- **Ensure** reliability, security, and compliance

### Platform Engineer vs Related Roles

**Platform Engineer**
- Builds internal platforms and developer tools
- Focus on developer experience and self-service
- Creates abstractions over infrastructure

**Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**
- Ensures service reliability and uptime
- Focus on SLOs, error budgets, and monitoring
- Responds to incidents and improves systems

**DevOps Engineer**
- Bridges development and operations
- Focus on CI/CD and automation
- Implements deployment pipelines

**Cloud Engineer**
- Manages cloud infrastructure
- Focus on specific cloud platforms
- Implements cloud-native solutions

## ðŸ“ˆ Why Platform Engineering?

- **High demand**: 87% of enterprises prioritizing platform teams
- **Great compensation**: $150K-$400K+ total compensation
- **Impact**: Enable entire engineering organizations
- **Growth**: Clear path to staff/principal roles
- **Innovation**: Work with cutting-edge technology

## âœ… Success Checklist

Before your interviews, ensure you can:

- [ ] Explain complex systems simply
- [ ] Design scalable infrastructure
- [ ] Write automation scripts quickly
- [ ] Discuss trade-offs intelligently
- [ ] Share relevant experiences effectively
