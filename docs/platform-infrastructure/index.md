# Platform Infrastructure

<GitHubButtons />
Build and scale the platforms that power modern applications.

## ðŸ“‹ What You'll Learn

This section covers modern platform infrastructure patterns:

1. **[Distributed Systems](./distributed-systems)** - Consistency, availability, partition tolerance

## ðŸŽ¯ Interview Focus Areas

### Critical Topics

Platform infrastructure interviews often focus on:

1. **System Design** (95% of interviews)
   - Scalability patterns
   - Data consistency models
   - Failure handling
   - Performance optimization

2. **Distributed Systems** (85% of interviews)
   - CAP theorem application
   - Consensus algorithms
   - Distributed transactions
   - Event-driven architecture

3. **Data Architecture** (80% of interviews)
   - SQL vs NoSQL trade-offs
   - Caching strategies
   - Data partitioning
   - Replication models

4. **Modern Patterns** (70% of interviews)
   - Microservices communication
   - Service mesh benefits
   - API gateway patterns
   - Event streaming

## ðŸ“š Essential Concepts

### Distributed Systems Fundamentals

**CAP Theorem**
- **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data
- **Availability**: System remains operational
- **Partition Tolerance**: System continues despite network failures
- You can only guarantee 2 out of 3

**Consistency Models**
- Strong consistency
- Eventual consistency
- Weak consistency
- Causal consistency

### Data Storage Patterns

**SQL Databases**
- ACID properties
- Strong consistency
- Complex queries
- Vertical scaling challenges

**NoSQL Databases**
- Document stores (MongoDB)
- Key-value stores (Redis)
- Column-family (Cassandra)
- Graph databases (Neo4j)

### Communication Patterns

**Synchronous**
- REST APIs
- GraphQL
- gRPC

**Asynchronous**
- Message queues
- Event streaming
- Pub/sub systems

## ðŸ’¡ Interview Strategies

### When Discussing Infrastructure

1. **Start with requirements**
   - Scale expectations
   - Consistency needs
   - Latency requirements
   - Cost constraints

2. **Consider trade-offs**
   - Performance vs cost
   - Consistency vs availability
   - Complexity vs maintainability

3. **Think about operations**
   - Monitoring and debugging
   - Deployment strategies
   - Disaster recovery
   - Team expertise

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Over-engineering for scale you don't need
- Ignoring operational complexity
- Not considering data consistency
- Forgetting about failure modes
- Underestimating costs

## ðŸ”§ Hands-On Skills

Before interviews, you should be able to:

- [ ] Design a distributed system handling 1M requests/second
- [ ] Choose appropriate database for different use cases
- [ ] Implement caching strategies
- [ ] Design event-driven architectures
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Configure service mesh

## ðŸ“Š Technology Landscape

### Popular Platforms & Tools

**Databases**
- PostgreSQL, MySQL (relational)
- MongoDB, DynamoDB (document)
- Redis, Memcached (cache)
- Cassandra, ScyllaDB (wide column)
- Kafka, Pulsar (streaming)

**Service Mesh**
- Istio
- Linkerd
- Consul Connect
- AWS App Mesh

**API Gateways**
- Kong
- Traefik
- AWS API Gateway
- Nginx Plus

**CI/CD**
- Jenkins
- GitLab CI
- GitHub Actions
- ArgoCD
- Tekton
