## Introduction

## What is Platform Engineering?

Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud-native era. Platform engineers provide an integrated product most often referred to as an "Internal Developer Platform" covering the operational necessities of the entire lifecycle of applications.

### Key Responsibilities
- **Build Internal Platforms**: Create self-service platforms that abstract infrastructure complexity
- **Enable Developer Productivity**: Reduce cognitive load on developers
- **Standardize Best Practices**: Implement golden paths for common scenarios
- **Maintain Reliability**: Ensure platform stability and performance

## Related Disciplines

### Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
Born at Google, SRE treats operations as a software problem. SREs use software engineering approaches to solve operational problems and create scalable, reliable systems.

**Focus Areas**: Error budgets, SLIs/SLOs, toil reduction, postmortems

### DevOps Engineering
DevOps bridges development and operations, emphasizing collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement throughout the software lifecycle.

**Focus Areas**: CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, monitoring, deployment strategies

### Production Engineering
Pioneered by Meta (Facebook), Production Engineers work embedded with product teams to ensure services are reliable and scalable from inception.

**Focus Areas**: Service architecture, capacity planning, performance optimization

## Career Landscape 2024

### Market Demand
- **87%** of enterprises are prioritizing platform engineering (Gartner, 2024)
- **25%** average salary premium over traditional ops roles
- **3x** growth in platform engineering job postings since 2021

### Top Skills in Demand
1. **Kubernetes & Container Orchestration** (mentioned in 76% of job posts)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Platform Engineer vs SRE vs DevOps - What's the difference?
**A:** While these roles overlap significantly:
- **Platform Engineers** build internal developer platforms and tools
- **SREs** focus on reliability, SLOs, and operational excellence  
- **DevOps Engineers** emphasize CI/CD and development-operations collaboration

Many companies use these titles interchangeably, so focus on the job responsibilities rather than the title.

### Q: Do I need to know how to code?
**A:** Yes! Modern platform engineering requires strong coding skills. Focus on:
- Python or Go for automation and tooling
- Bash for system administration
- Understanding of data structures and algorithms

### Q: Which cloud should I learn first?
**A:** Start with AWS as it has the largest market share, then expand to GCP or Azure based on your target companies. The concepts transfer well between clouds.

### Q: How important are certifications?
**A:** Certifications can help, especially early in your career, but hands-on experience is more valuable. Popular certifications:
- AWS Solutions Architect / DevOps Engineer
- CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)
- GCP Professional Cloud Architect

### Q: What's the typical interview process?
**A:** Most companies follow this pattern:
1. Recruiter screen (30 min)
2. Technical phone screen (45-60 min)
3. Onsite loop (4-6 hours): Coding, System Design, Behavioral, Domain expertise
