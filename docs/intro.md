# Platform Engineering Playbook

## Why I Made This

I started this playbook mostly for myself! Working in platform engineering means keeping track of _a ton_ of different technologies.Kubernetes, Terraform, observability tools, CI/CD systems, cloud services, networking concepts, and on and on. I was constantly forgetting the specifics of tools I hadn't used in a while or trying to remember which resources actually helped me learn something properly.

So, I looked through several other sites devoted to SRE, DevOps, Production Engineering, and of course, Platform Engineering. I then asked a bunch of different AI tools to add the best resources they could find to the list of technologies. I also asked them to look at [salary data](https://platformengineeringplaybook.com/blog/why-elasticsearch-engineers-earn-more-than-cloud-architects) to see what technologies were actually in demand.

Now, as I review, I am going through each page and making sure that I love all the linked resources. I'm also generating audio summaries so that I can get a quick high level overview of the current state of the art in each technology. I'm hoping this will help me keep track of the latest trends and technologies in the field.

I invite everyone to contribute to the playbook! If you find any errorrs, or know of resources that should be added, please make a PR!

## What This Actually Is

This is basically a curated index of platform engineering technologies. It's not trying to teach you everything from scratchâ€”there are already great resources for that. Instead, it's more like a organized directory of 150+ tools and concepts that show up in platform engineering work, each with links to the best learning materials I've found.

Think of it as that bookmark folder you wish you had organized better, but actually organized.

## Where to Start

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', margin: '2rem 0'}}>
<a href="/technical-skills" style={{
  display: 'inline-block',
  padding: '1rem 2rem',
  fontSize: '1.2rem',
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  color: 'white',
  backgroundColor: '#0066cc',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  textDecoration: 'none',
  border: 'none',
  cursor: 'pointer',
  transition: 'background-color 0.2s ease'
}} onMouseOver={(e) => e.target.style.backgroundColor = '#0052a3'} onMouseOut={(e) => e.target.style.backgroundColor = '#0066cc'}>
ðŸ“š Browse the Technical Skills â†’
</a>
</div>

That's where all the technology overviews live, organized by category (Linux & Systems, Cloud Platforms, Containers, etc.).

If you're looking for other stuff like interview prep or career guidance, those sections exist too, but the technical reference is the main event.

_This started as my personal notes and grew from there. If it helps you keep track of this stuff too, great._
