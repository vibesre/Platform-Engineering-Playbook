## Introduction

### What is Platform Engineering?

Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing, building, and maintaining Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that enable development teams to autonomously manage their applications' lifecycle without requiring deep infrastructure expertise.

### What is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)?

SRE is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems. The main goals are to create scalable and highly reliable software systems.

### What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

### Career Paths

These roles often overlap but have distinct focus areas:

- **SRE**: Focus on reliability, scalability, and system design
- **Platform Engineer**: Focus on building developer tools and platforms
- **DevOps Engineer**: Focus on CI/CD, automation, and deployment
- **Production Engineer**: Facebook's variant combining SRE and software engineering
