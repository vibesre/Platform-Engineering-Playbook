# Platform Engineering Playbook

## Why I Made This

Honestly, I started this playbook mostly for myself. Working in platform engineering means keeping track of *a lot* of different technologies—Kubernetes, Terraform, observability tools, CI/CD systems, cloud services, networking concepts, and on and on. I was constantly forgetting the specifics of tools I hadn't used in a while or trying to remember which resources actually helped me learn something properly.

So I began collecting the good tutorials, documentation, and courses in one place. Just a personal reference, really. But then I realized other folks might be dealing with the same "wait, how does ArgoCD work again?" moments, so I figured I'd share it.

## What This Actually Is

This is basically a curated index of platform engineering technologies. It's not trying to teach you everything from scratch—there are already great resources for that. Instead, it's more like a organized directory of 150+ tools and concepts that show up in platform engineering work, each with links to the best learning materials I've found.

Think of it as that bookmark folder you wish you had organized better, but actually organized.

## Where to Start

**[→ Check out the Technical Skills section](/technical-skills)** - that's where all the technology overviews live, organized by category (Linux & Systems, Cloud Platforms, Containers, etc.).

If you're looking for other stuff like interview prep or career guidance, those sections exist too, but the technical reference is the main event.

*This started as my personal notes and grew from there. If it helps you keep track of this stuff too, great.*
