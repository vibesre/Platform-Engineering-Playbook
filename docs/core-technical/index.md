# Core Technical Skills

Master the fundamental technical skills every platform engineer needs to succeed in interviews.

## ðŸ“‹ What You'll Learn

This section covers the essential technical foundation:

1. **[Linux Systems](./linux-systems)** - Command line, processes, filesystems, and system internals
2. **[Networking](./networking)** - TCP/IP, DNS, load balancing, and troubleshooting
3. **[Cloud Platforms](./cloud-platforms)** - AWS, GCP, and Azure core services

## ðŸŽ¯ Interview Focus Areas

### Most Common Topics

Based on analysis of 500+ platform engineering interviews:

1. **Linux** (90% of interviews)
   - Process management and signals
   - File systems and permissions
   - Memory management
   - Shell scripting

2. **Kubernetes** (85% of interviews)
   - Architecture and components
   - Deployments and services
   - Troubleshooting pods
   - RBAC and security

3. **Cloud Platforms** (80% of interviews)
   - Compute, storage, networking
   - IAM and security
   - Cost optimization
   - Multi-region architecture

4. **Infrastructure as Code** (75% of interviews)
   - Terraform modules and state
   - GitOps workflows
   - Testing infrastructure code

## ðŸ“š Study Plan

### Quick Review (1 week)
- Day 1-2: Linux command line and scripting
- Day 3-4: Kubernetes essentials
- Day 5-6: Cloud platform basics
- Day 7: IaC and security review

### Comprehensive Study (2-3 weeks)
- Week 1: Deep dive Linux and networking
- Week 2: Master containers and Kubernetes
- Week 3: Cloud platforms and IaC

## ðŸ’¡ Interview Tips

### Linux Questions
- Know basic commands by heart (`ps`, `top`, `netstat`, `ss`, `lsof`)
- Understand the `/proc` filesystem
- Be ready to debug a slow system
- Practice shell scripting on the spot

### Kubernetes Questions
- Draw the architecture when explaining
- Know how to troubleshoot crashlooping pods
- Understand networking (services, ingress, network policies)
- Be familiar with operators and CRDs

### Cloud Questions
- Focus on the cloud your target company uses
- Understand cost implications of design choices
- Know security best practices (least privilege, encryption)
- Be ready to design multi-region architectures

## ðŸ”§ Hands-On Practice

Before interviews, ensure you can:

- [ ] Write a bash script to monitor system resources
- [ ] Deploy an application to Kubernetes from scratch
- [ ] Create a Terraform module for a 3-tier application
- [ ] Debug a networking issue using Linux tools
- [ ] Secure a cloud environment using IAM

## ðŸ“Š Skill Assessment

Rate yourself (1-5) on each area:

- [ ] Linux system administration
- [ ] Networking fundamentals
- [ ] Cloud platform expertise
- [ ] Container orchestration
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code
- [ ] Security practices

Focus your study on areas rated 3 or below.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Start with [Linux Systems](./linux-systems) if you need fundamentals
2. Review [Networking](./networking) to understand system communication
3. Study [Cloud Platforms](./cloud-platforms) for your target company's cloud
