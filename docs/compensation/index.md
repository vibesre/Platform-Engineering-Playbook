    # Equity value (assuming linear vesting)
    equity_total = offer['equity_grant']
    
    # Bonuses
    signing = offer.get('signing_bonus', 0)
    annual_bonus = offer['base_salary'] * offer.get('bonus_pct', 0.15)
    bonus_total = signing + (annual_bonus * years)
    
    # Benefits value
    benefits_annual = offer.get('benefits_value', 20000)
    benefits_total = benefits_annual * years
    
    total = base_total + equity_total + bonus_total + benefits_total
    annual_avg = total / years
    
    return {
        'total_4_year': total,
