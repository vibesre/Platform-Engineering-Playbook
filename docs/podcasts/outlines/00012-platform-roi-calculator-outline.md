# Episode Outline: Platform Engineering ROI Calculator - Translate Success Into Survival

## Story Planning

**NARRATIVE STRUCTURE**: Economic Detective Story + Before/After Transformation

**CENTRAL TENSION**: Platform teams are technically successful but still get disbanded because they can't translate engineering metrics into executive-speak. 45% don't measure anything—and pay with their existence.

**THROUGHLINE**: From technical success without survival to mastering the language that keeps platform teams funded—measuring and communicating ROI in dollars, not deployments.

**EMOTIONAL ARC**:
- **Recognition moment**: "We doubled deployment frequency but the CFO asked for ROI and we froze"
- **Surprise moment**: "The issue isn't our platform—it's that we're speaking Kubernetes when they speak cash flow"
- **Empowerment moment**: "Here's the exact formula and templates that saved three platform teams from disbandment"

## Act Structure

### ACT 1: THE DISBANDMENT CRISIS (2-3 minutes)

**Hook**: "Your platform team is 18 months old. Budget review is next quarter. The CFO asks: 'What's our ROI?' You freeze. You know deployment frequency doubled. You know developers love the portal. But you can't translate that into dollars. This is how 60-70% of platform teams get disbanded."

**Stakes**:
- 45% of platform teams measure nothing at all
- 26% "don't know" if they're improving
- When budget reviews come, they have no answer → disbandment
- It's not about technical failure—it's about communication failure

**Promise**: We'll reveal the ROI calculation framework that saved platform teams from the chopping block, with real numbers from startups to enterprises.

**Key Points**:
- The budget review scenario: Platform lead says "developers are happier, deployments are faster" → CFO asks "by how much? what's the dollar value?" → no answer → team cut from 6 to 2 people
- The measurement gap: Teams track deployment frequency (20/day), platform adoption (73%), developer NPS (+42) BUT CFOs need: dollar value of productivity, cost savings, payback period, ROI percentage
- The disconnect: Engineering metrics vs finance metrics - this gap is where teams die
- Callback to Episode 11: We identified the problem (45% don't measure), now we're solving it

**Narrative Technique**: Open with relatable scenario → establish emotional connection → preview the solution

### ACT 2: THE ROI FRAMEWORK UNVEILED (6-7 minutes)

**Discovery 1 - The Formula** (2 minutes):
Reveal the simple but powerful calculation:

```
Platform ROI = (Total Value - Total Cost) / Total Cost × 100

Total Value = Developer Productivity + Cost Savings + Retention Savings
Total Cost = Platform Team + Tools + Infrastructure
```

**Example walkthrough** (200-engineer company):
- **Productivity**: 3 hours saved/dev/week × 200 devs × 50 weeks × $75/hour = $2.25M
- **Cloud savings**: 25% reduction on $120K/month = $360K annually
- **Retention**: Prevent 3 senior departures × $120K replacement cost = $360K
- **Total Value**: $2.97M
- **Cost**: 8 platform engineers ($1.2M) + tools ($180K) + infrastructure ($120K) = $1.5M
- **ROI**: ($2.97M - $1.5M) / $1.5M = **98% first year, 300% by year 2**

**Discovery 2 - Real Numbers Across Company Sizes** (2 minutes):

Present the comparison table with surprising pattern:

| Company Size | Engineers | Platform Team | Annual Cost | Annual Value | ROI |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----|
| **Startup** | 50 | 3 FTE | $450K | $1.5M | **233%** |
| **Mid-Size** | 200 | 8 FTE | $1.2M | $4.8M | **300%** |
| **Enterprise** | 1000+ | 25 FTE | $3.75M | $18M | **380%** |

**Key insight**: ROI improves at scale because:
- Fixed costs amortize across more developers
- Network effects compound
- Expertise accumulates over time

**Discovery 3 - Translating DORA to Dollars** (2 minutes):

The critical translation layer most teams miss:

**DORA metric** → **Business outcome** → **Dollar value**

Examples:
- **Deployment frequency** (2/week → 20/day) → Shipped 12 features vs 6 planned → $2M additional revenue
- **MTTR** (4 hours → 30 minutes) → 90% less customer-facing downtime → Prevented $300K in SLA penalties
- **Change failure rate** (15% → 3%) → 80% fewer production incidents → $480K in downtime costs avoided

**Story**: SaaS company case study - Before platform vs After platform (12 months later), showing $3.28M business value from $1.2M investment = 273% ROI

**Complication**: "But what if you have under 100 engineers?"

Reveal the hard truth:
- Under 100 engineers: Platform overhead likely exceeds benefit
- Better alternatives: Render, Fly.io, Railway ($500-$5K/month vs $450K/year for team)
- Red flag: Can't dedicate 3+ FTE minimum
- Decision framework: Don't build if existing pain costs less than $450K/year

**Key Points**:
- The formula is simple—the hard part is measuring inputs consistently
- ROI improves at scale (233% at 50 engineers → 380% at 1000+)
- DORA metrics alone mean nothing to executives—translation is everything
- Not every company should build a platform team (honest assessment)

**Supporting Data**:
- 45% don't measure (State of Platform Engineering 2024)
- 200-400% ROI typical when measured (case study aggregation)
- $100K-$150K cost to replace senior engineer (industry benchmarks)
- 20-40% developer productivity improvement (DORA 2024)

**Narrative Technique**: Economic detective - uncover hidden value, quantify invisible costs, reveal surprising ROI patterns

### ACT 3: SPEAKING THEIR LANGUAGE (3-4 minutes)

**Synthesis - The Stakeholder Translation**:

Different executives care about different metrics—speak their language:

**For the CFO**:
- Cloud waste reduction: "$300K annual savings from 25% spend reduction"
- Retention savings: "Prevented 4 departures = $400K-$600K saved"
- Payback period: "Platform paid for itself in 6 months, now 3X return"

**For the CTO**:
- Deployment frequency: "10X improvement"
- Lead time: "2 weeks to 2 days = 7X faster shipping"
- Competitive advantage: "Features weeks before competitors"

**For VP Engineering**:
- Developer NPS: "-5 to +35 (40-point swing)"
- Retention: "82% to 94% for senior engineers"
- Recruiting: "Platform highlighted in interviews as differentiator"

**Application - The Monday Morning Action Plan**:

**This Week**:
1. Establish baseline metrics (DORA, NPS, cloud costs, incidents)
2. Document current state - you can't prove improvement without a baseline
3. Share with leadership to set expectations

**This Month**:
4. Create stakeholder templates (CFO deck, CTO dashboard)
5. Set up automated DORA tracking
6. Schedule quarterly business review cadence

**This Quarter**:
7. Run first ROI calculation with real numbers
8. Present to leadership with dollar values
9. Refine based on feedback

**Empowerment - The Survival Truth**:

"The platform teams that survive aren't the ones with the best technology. They're the ones that can articulate their business value in the CFO's language.

45% of platform teams measure nothing and get disbanded. Don't be in that 45%.

Start measuring today—your baseline determines whether you'll be here in 18 months."

**Practical deliverable mentioned**: ROI calculator, CFO presentation template, DORA → Business outcomes mapping guide (all referenced in blog post)

**Closing callback**: "We identified why 70% of platform teams fail in Episode 11. Today, we gave you the framework to be in the 30% that succeed. Measurement isn't optional—it's survival."
