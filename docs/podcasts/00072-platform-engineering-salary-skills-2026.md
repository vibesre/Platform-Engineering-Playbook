2. **AI is a force multiplier, not a replacement** - Learn to work with AI, not compete against it
3. **Platform Engineering premium persists** - 13-27% over DevOps, expected to continue
4. **Compound skills create multipliers** - DevSecOps, MLOps create premium on premium
5. **The fundamentals remain constant** - Invest in skills that compound, not skills that commoditize
