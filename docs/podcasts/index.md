# The Platform Engineering Playbook Podcast

<GitHubButtons />

Welcome to The Platform Engineering Playbook Podcast — where everything you hear is built, reviewed, and improved by AI, by me, and by you, the listener.

This show keeps me — and hopefully you — up to speed on the latest in platform engineering, SRE, DevOps, and production engineering. It's a living experiment in how AI can help us track, explain, and debate the fast-moving world of infrastructure.

Every episode is open source. If you've got something to add, correct, or challenge, head to [GitHub](https://github.com/vibesre/Platform-Engineering-Playbook) — open a pull request, join the conversation, and make the Playbook smarter.

**Target Audience**: Senior platform engineers, SREs, DevOps engineers with 5+ years experience seeking strategic insights on technology choices, market dynamics, and skill optimization.
