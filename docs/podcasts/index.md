# The Platform Engineering Playbook Podcast

<GitHubButtons />

Welcome to The Platform Engineering Playbook Podcast — where everything you hear is built, reviewed, and improved by AI, by me, and by you, the listener.

This show keeps me — and hopefully you — up to speed on the latest in platform engineering, SRE, DevOps, and production engineering. It's a living experiment in how AI can help us track, explain, and debate the fast-moving world of infrastructure.

Every episode is open source. If you've got something to add, correct, or challenge, head to [GitHub](https://github.com/vibesre/Platform-Engineering-Playbook) — open a pull request, join the conversation, and make the Playbook smarter.

**Target Audience**: Senior platform engineers, SREs, DevOps engineers with 5+ years experience seeking strategic insights on technology choices, market dynamics, and skill optimization.

### Episode 8: GCP State of the Union 2025

[🎙️ GCP State of the Union 2025: When Depth Beats Breadth](/podcasts/00008-gcp-state-of-the-union-2025)

GCP grows at 32% while AWS manages 17%—nearly 2x faster despite having half the services. We break down why Google's depth-over-breadth strategy is winning AI/ML and data workloads in 2025. Learn about 3x network performance advantages, automatic sustained use discounts (no Reserved Instance forecasting!), and when GCP's specialist positioning beats AWS's generalist approach.

**Duration:** 17 minutes

### Episode 7: AWS Outage October 2025

[🎙️ The $75 Million Per Hour Lesson: Inside the 2025 AWS US-EAST-1 Outage](/podcasts/00007-aws-outage-october-2025)

October 19, 2025. 11:48 PM. Ring doorbells stop. Robinhood freezes trading. Roblox goes dark. 6.5 million outage reports globally. A DNS race condition in DynamoDB cascaded into 70+ AWS services down, affecting 1000+ companies from gaming to government. We dissect the technical failure, the $75M/hour cost, and what it reveals about single-region control plane dependencies. Essential listening for multi-cloud strategy and resilience planning.

**Duration:** 16 minutes
