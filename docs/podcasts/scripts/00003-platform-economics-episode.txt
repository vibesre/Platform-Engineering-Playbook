Jordan: Today we're diving into something every platform team faces but nobody wants to talk about—the economics of platform engineering. [pause] Specifically, why you're probably bleeding money on tools you don't use and metrics that don't matter.

Alex: We'll talk about the hidden costs of tool sprawl, [pause] why traditional <say-as interpret-as="characters">ROI</say-as> metrics are basically lying to us, [pause] and what actually matters when you're trying to justify platform investments to your CFO.

Jordan: Plus, we'll get into build versus buy decisions, [pause] what skills are becoming table stakes, [pause] and some practical steps you can take Monday morning to start fixing this mess.

Alex: So let me paint a picture that's probably familiar to our listeners. Small company: 15 to 20 tools. Medium business: 50 to 60. Large enterprise? [pause] We're talking 130-plus.

Jordan: And the kicker—teams are using maybe 10 to 20 percent of the capabilities they're paying for.

Alex: Right. There's this stat that keeps me up at night—engineers are managing an average of 16 monitoring tools. When SLAs get strict? [pause] That jumps to 40.

Jordan: Wait, 40 monitoring tools? [pause] How does anyone even manage that?

Alex: They don't. That's the point. It's this accumulation problem, right? [pause] Every team picks their favorite, nobody wants to migrate, and suddenly you're in what I call "tool sprawl hell."

Jordan: I've been there. We had three different <say-as interpret-as="characters">APM</say-as> solutions because each team swore theirs was critical. Turns out, they were all monitoring the same services, just differently.

Alex: And here's where it gets expensive. Global spend on security tools alone? [pause] Projected to hit 261 billion dollars by 2025.

Jordan: Billion with a capital B.

Alex: But the real cost isn't even the licenses. So first, there's the context switching tax. Microsoft research shows it takes 23 minutes to fully refocus after switching contexts.

Jordan: 23 minutes. And if you're jumping between 16 tools, that's almost 4 hours per day. For a 150-K engineer, that's 71 thousand dollars per year in lost productivity. Per engineer.

Alex: But wait, there's more. Remember that "cost-saving" custom monitoring solution your team built two years ago?

Jordan: Oh no, I know where this is going.

Alex: 20 to 30 percent of your team's capacity. That's the ongoing maintenance burden for self-built platform tools that people consistently underestimate.

Jordan: We had this exact situation with a custom deployment tool. "It'll save us money," we said. Two years later, we had two full-time engineers basically just keeping it alive.

Alex: And then there's my new favorite category—<say-as interpret-as="characters">AI</say-as> trust debt. Companies spent an average of 400-K on <say-as interpret-as="characters">AI</say-as>-native apps last year. 75 percent year-over-year increase.

Jordan: But I'm sensing a "but" coming.

Alex: Only 29 percent of developers actually trust the <say-as interpret-as="characters">AI</say-as> outputs. And 66 percent report spending more time debugging <say-as interpret-as="characters">AI</say-as>-generated code than expected.

Jordan: So we're paying premium prices for tools that create more work?

Alex: In many cases, yes. It's like we learned nothing from the low-code revolution.

Jordan: This brings us to something I'm really passionate about—why traditional <say-as interpret-as="characters">ROI</say-as> metrics are essentially lying to us.

Alex: Oh, this is good. Go on.

Jordan: So a platform engineering manager told me something that stuck: "What they mean by <say-as interpret-as="characters">ROI</say-as> is convince me that this change is going to have benefits we can represent as money."

Alex: Right, everything has to be dollarized.

Jordan: But here's the thing—what even is productivity in development? [pause] If we optimize for lead time, like DORA suggests, we might discourage engineers from taking time to do things right.

Alex: The Goodhart problem—when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

Jordan: Exactly. I've seen teams game every metric. Lines of code? [pause] You get verbose code. Commit frequency? [pause] You get tiny, meaningless commits. Story points? [pause] Don't get me started.

Alex: So what metrics actually matter?

Jordan: IDC did this study—downtime costs between 500-K to over a million dollars per hour, depending on industry. That's your North Star. Everything else should ladder up to availability and recovery.

Alex: Platform teams that focus on this see real results too. 40 percent fewer outages, 60 percent reduction in incident management costs, 60 percent faster recovery times.

Jordan: And change failure rate—if it's over 15 percent, you're spending too much time fixing instead of shipping.

Alex: Let's tackle the elephant in the room—build versus buy. Because I keep seeing this pattern where teams think building their own will save money.

Jordan: Spoiler alert: it usually doesn't.

Alex: Well, there are exceptions. I know a company that saved 800-K a year moving off <say-as interpret-as="characters">AWS</say-as>.

Jordan: Sure, but what was their scale?

Alex: Exactly the right question. They were spending millions. For most teams, the math doesn't work out. There's this startup I worked with—they saved 20-K annually just by consolidating licenses. No custom building required.

Jordan: I think the threshold is around 5 engineers. Below that, you simply don't have the bandwidth for custom platform tools.

Alex: And even above that, the hybrid approach is winning in 2025. Buy the foundation, build the differentiators.

Jordan: Spotify does this brilliantly. They use standard tools for most things but build custom stuff for their specific music streaming challenges.

Alex: Speaking of alternatives, let's talk about some of the underdogs in this space. Because not everything has to be <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˌkubɚˈnɛtiz">Kubernetes</phoneme>.

Jordan: Thank you. The <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˌkubɚˈnɛtiz">Kubernetes</phoneme> complexity backlash is real.

Alex: For teams under 5 engineers? [pause] Look at <say-as interpret-as="characters">AWS</say-as> App Runner, Fly.io, even good old Docker Compose for development.

Jordan: We've also been seeing Nomad gain traction in specific use cases. It's like <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˌkubɚˈnɛtiz">Kubernetes</phoneme> but with 80 percent less cognitive overhead.

Alex: And for the "I just need to run some containers" crowd, Railway and Render are doing interesting things.

Jordan: The key is matching complexity to actual needs. You don't need a Formula 1 car to go to the grocery store.

Alex: So given all this economic pressure, what skills should platform engineers focus on?

Jordan: Financial literacy is becoming table stakes. You need to speak CFO.

Alex: FinOps certification might actually be worth it now.

Jordan: Also, product management skills. The most successful platform teams think like product teams. User research, continuous discovery, measuring adoption not compliance.

Alex: What's losing relevance?

Jordan: Deep expertise in any single tool. The ability to learn and consolidate tools quickly is worth more than being a Jenkins wizard.

Alex: Harsh but true. What about emerging skills?

Jordan: Platform as a Product thinking, cost optimization automation, and honestly? [pause] The ability to say no. To new tools, to complexity, to features that don't move the needle.

Alex: Let's get practical. If I'm a platform engineer listening to this, what do I do Monday morning?

Jordan: Tool audit. List everything, map actual usage versus licenses, calculate true costs including training and context switching.

Alex: And be honest about that usage. We found teams claiming they "needed" tools they hadn't logged into in six months.

Jordan: Then identify your biggest overlap. Monitoring is usually the worst offender. Do you really need Datadog AND New Relic AND <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="prəˈmiθiəs">Prometheus</phoneme> AND CloudWatch?

Alex: Pick one area for consolidation. Just one. Prove the value, then expand.

Jordan: And start measuring differently. Track incidents reduced, recovery time improved, developer satisfaction. Connect these to dollar values.

Alex: Most importantly—involve your developers. If they bypass your platform to use their own tools, you've already lost.

Jordan: You know what struck me while preparing for this episode? [pause] We've created this entire industry around managing complexity we created ourselves.

Alex: It's like Conway's Law, but with tools. Every team adds their favorite, and suddenly you're spending more on tool management than actual development.

Jordan: The fundamentals of good engineering remain constant, even as the landscape evolves. [pause] And here's the takeaway: the best platform is the one your developers choose to use, not the one you mandate.

Alex: Consolidation is coming whether we like it or not. The economics simply don't support 130-tool portfolios anymore. [pause] Start with one area, prove the value, and expand from there.
