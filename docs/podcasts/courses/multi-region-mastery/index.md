# Multi-Region Platform Engineering: AWS, Kubernetes, and Aurora at Scale

<GitHubButtons />

A comprehensive 16-episode course on building production-grade multi-region architectures. Learn the LEGO architecture approach - master individual building blocks (Aurora Global Database, EKS, Transit Gateway, DynamoDB Global Tables) and understand how to compose them for your specific requirements.

**Target Audience**: Senior platform engineers, SREs, DevOps engineers with 5+ years of production experience

**Course Philosophy**: Brutal honesty over marketing hype. We'll show you the real costs, the hidden complexity, and when single-region is actually the better choice. By the end, you'll think of multi-region components as composable building blocks you can assemble to meet your organization's specific needs.

## Learning Approach

This course uses evidence-based learning science principles:

**Spaced Repetition**: Key concepts (like the CCC Triangle) are introduced early and reinforced 3-5 times throughout the course

**Progressive Complexity**: Each episode builds on previous lessons, adding one new layer of complexity

**Active Recall**: Regular pause points ask you to apply concepts before revealing solutions

**Real Numbers**: Every cost, latency, and performance claim is sourced from production data

**LEGO Architecture**: Think of each AWS service as a composable building block - understand how each piece works and how to fit them together
