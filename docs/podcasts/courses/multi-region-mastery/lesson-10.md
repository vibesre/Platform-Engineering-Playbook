## What You'll Learn

- **CAP theorem reality**: You choose two of Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance
- **Aurora's CP model**: Strong consistency, read-only during partition, acceptable for most transactional workloads
- **DynamoDB's AP model**: High availability, eventual consistency, last-writer-wins conflict resolution
- **Split-brain scenarios**: Two regions think they're primary, data divergence, reconciliation nightmare
- **Prevention strategies**: Quorum consensus, human approval gates, resource fencing
