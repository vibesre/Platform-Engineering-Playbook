## What You'll Learn

- **Istio multi-cluster architecture**: Shared control plane vs replicated control plane
- **Subsecond failover mechanics**: Active health checking, immediate rerouting, no DNS TTL delays
- **Operational complexity**: Certificate management (mTLS), mesh upgrades, debugging service mesh config
- **Performance overhead**: Sidecar proxy latency, CPU/memory per pod
- **When service mesh makes sense**: Hot-hot with subsecond RTO requirements, complex traffic management needs
