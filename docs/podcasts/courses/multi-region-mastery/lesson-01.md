## What You'll Learn

- **Cost, Complexity, Capability (CCC) Triangle** mental model - the fundamental trade-offs
- **True cost multiplier**: 2.5x-7.5x (not the 2x vendors claim)
- **Single Points of Failure** in "multi-region" AWS architectures that can bring down your entire system
- **Decision framework**: Calculate actual downtime cost vs multi-region premium
- **Hidden costs**: Engineering time (500-1000 hours implementation) plus ongoing operational complexity

## Key Takeaways

- Multi-region costs 2.5-7.5x more (not 2x): Data transfer is the silent killer at $0.02/GB
- The Cost-Complexity-Capability triangle: You can optimize for two vertices, never all three
- Hidden SPOFs exist even in multi-region: Route53, IAM, ACM all depend on US-EAST-1 control planes
- 80% of companies don't need multi-region: Do the math‚Äî$10M revenue = $1,140/hour downtime cost
- Engineering time is the largest hidden cost
- Decision framework: Calculate actual downtime cost vs multi-region premium to know if it's worth it
