## What You'll Learn

- **Anti-pattern 1**: Synchronous cross-region calls, 100-200ms latency added, cascading timeouts
- **Anti-pattern 2**: Ignoring data affinity, $12K → $95K monthly data transfer costs
- **Anti-pattern 3**: Insufficient DR testing, discovering broken runbooks during actual outage
- **Anti-pattern 4**: Shared fate dependencies, IAM/Route53 in us-east-1 single points of failure
- **Anti-pattern 5**: Over-engineering, hot-hot when hot-warm sufficient, 7.5x cost without matching business requirement
- **Anti-pattern 6**: Missing observability, blind during failover, cross-region tracing essential
