## What You'll Learn

- **RTO/RPO and cost trade-offs** for each pattern
- **Hot-warm**: 5-minute RTO, reasonable cost - the most common production pattern
- **Hot-hot**: Subsecond failover, 7.5x cost multiplier
- **Hot-cold**: 30+ minute RTO, 2x cost, acceptable for non-critical workloads
- **Pattern selection framework**: Match architecture to actual business downtime costs

## Key Takeaways

- Hot-hot architecture: Subsecond failover, 7.5x cost multiplier, requires active-active database writes
- Hot-warm architecture: 5-minute RTO, 3-4x cost, most common production pattern for pragmatic teams
- Hot-cold architecture: 30+ minute RTO, 2x cost, acceptable for non-critical workloads
- RTO vs RPO trade-offs: Understand Recovery Time Objective and Recovery Point Objective requirements
- Cost comparison: Real production numbers showing infrastructure spend across patterns
- Pattern selection framework: Match architecture to actual business downtime costs, not fear-driven design
