## What You'll Learn

- **Route53 health check mechanics**: 30-second intervals, failover detection, DNS propagation delays
- **DNS TTL trade-offs**: Low TTL (60s) = faster failover but more DNS queries, high TTL (300s) = lower cost but slower
- **Global Accelerator architecture**: Anycast IP addresses, AWS edge locations, TCP/UDP optimization
- **Subsecond routing with anycast**: Traffic routed to nearest healthy endpoint automatically
- **Cost comparison**: Route53 ($0.50/health check) vs Global Accelerator ($18/month/endpoint)
