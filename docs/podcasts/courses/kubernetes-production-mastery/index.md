**Presenter**: Production Engineering Instructor
**Total Duration**: 10 episodes, ~2.5 hours total
**Target Audience**: Senior platform engineers, SREs, DevOps engineers with 5+ years experience
**Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced

## Course Overview

You know Kubernetes basics‚ÄîPods, Deployments, Services. You've followed tutorials and deployed to development clusters. But here's the reality: **98% of organizations face challenges running Kubernetes in production**. Not development. Production.

This course bridges the gap between "it works on my laptop" and "it works at scale under load with real users." We cover **the complete production operations toolkit**: failure pattern prevention, stateful workloads, observability, security, cost optimization, and GitOps automation.

Through 10 focused episodes, you'll learn systematic debugging workflows, production-ready configurations, and decision frameworks used by senior engineers managing 20+ clusters in production environments.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:
- **Diagnose and prevent** the 5 most common Kubernetes production failures
- **Debug systematically**: OOMKilled, CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, networking, storage issues
- **Secure production clusters** with RBAC best practices and secrets management (Sealed Secrets, External Secrets)
- **Deploy stateful workloads**: Databases, caches, and message queues with StatefulSets and persistent storage
- **Build observability stack**: Prometheus metrics, log aggregation, actionable alerts using golden signals
- **Implement GitOps**: Deployment automation with ArgoCD or Flux, Helm vs Kustomize decision-making
- **Optimize costs**: FinOps techniques for resource right-sizing and waste elimination
- **Operate at scale**: Multi-cluster management patterns for 20+ cluster environments

### Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:
- Basic Kubernetes knowledge (Pods, Deployments, Services, kubectl)
- Docker container experience
- Production engineering or SRE experience (5+ years recommended)
- Familiarity with command-line tools

### Time Commitment

- **Total Duration**: ~2.5 hours (10 episodes √ó 12-18 min average)
- **Recommended Pace**: 2-3 episodes per week
- **Completion Time**: 3-4 weeks at recommended pace

## About This Course

This course uses evidence-based learning techniques to maximize retention and practical application:

- **Spaced Repetition**: Key concepts reviewed across multiple episodes for 2-3x better retention
- **Active Recall**: Retrieval prompts throughout strengthen memory formation
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each lesson builds achievably on previous knowledge
- **Real-World Focus**: Production scenarios based on actual incidents and 2024 industry data (98% face production challenges, 20+ cluster average)

**Course Philosophy**: We assume you're an experienced engineer who knows the basics. We don't waste time re-teaching Pods. Instead, we focus on the gaps between tutorials and production reality‚Äîthe knowledge that takes years to learn through trial, error, and 2 AM incidents.

**What Makes This Course Complete**: Unlike most K8s training that focuses only on getting things running, this course covers the full production operations toolkit: stateful workloads (databases), observability (Prometheus, logging), security (RBAC, secrets), cost optimization (FinOps), and GitOps automation. Everything you need to operate Kubernetes at scale in production.
