## Lesson Flow

### 1. Recall & Connection (1.5 min)

**Callback to Episode 1**:
"In Episode 1, we covered the production readiness checklist. Remember the number one item? Resource limits and requests set. Every container must have both.

But here's the thing—most engineers I talk to can't explain WHY you need both. They know you're supposed to set them. They copy-paste examples from Stack Overflow. But they don't understand the actual mechanism."

**Active Recall Prompt #1**:
"Before we dive in, pause and recall from Episode 1: What was the cost of that Black Friday OOMKilled incident? [PAUSE] Ninety-four thousand dollars in forty-seven minutes. All because resource limits weren't configured.

Today, we're making sure you never have that problem."

**Connection to Today**:
"This lesson builds directly on that checklist item. We're going deep. By the end, you'll understand requests vs limits at a level where you can debug OOMKilled errors in production, architect resource allocation for entire clusters, and make intelligent trade-off decisions.

Let's go."

**Why This Matters Now**:
"Here's the reality. Exit code 137—OOMKilled—is the single most common production failure in Kubernetes. Sixty-seven percent of teams have experienced it. If you don't master resource management today, you WILL get paged at three AM."

---

### 2. Learning Objectives (30 sec)

"By the end of this fifteen-minute lesson, you'll be able to:
- Explain the difference between requests and limits, and why Kubernetes needs both
- Debug an OOMKilled pod from exit code 137 to root cause using a systematic workflow
- Right-size your containers using load testing and Quality of Service principles"

---

### 3. Concept Introduction: Requests vs Limits (3 min)

**The Fundamental Misunderstanding**:
"Most engineers think requests and limits do the same thing. They don't.

Requests are for the scheduler. Limits are for the runtime.

Two completely different systems. Two completely different purposes."

**Analogy #1 - Hotel Reservation**:
"Think of resource requests like booking a hotel room.

You request a room with one king bed. The hotel guarantees that room exists and is available for you. That's your request—it's a guarantee from the system that these resources will be available.

But here's the key: Just because you requested a king bed doesn't mean you'll USE the whole room. Maybe you only sleep on half the bed. Maybe you don't use the mini-bar. The hotel still reserves the room for you—that's scheduling.

Resource limits? That's the fire marshal saying this room can hold a maximum of four people. Try to cram in a fifth? Fire code violation. System says no.

In Kubernetes: Requests ensure your pod gets scheduled on a node with sufficient resources. Limits prevent your pod from consuming unlimited resources and crashing other workloads."

**Concrete Example - The Numbers**:
"Let's get specific. Your API pod.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: 512Mi
    cpu: 250m
  limits:
    memory: 1Gi
    cpu: 500m
```

What this means:
- **Scheduler**: Kubernetes finds a node with at least 512 megabytes available memory and 250 millicores available CPU. That's the scheduling guarantee.
- **Runtime**: Your pod can USE up to 1 gigabyte of memory and 500 millicores of CPU. If it tries to exceed 1 gigabyte? OOMKilled. Exit code 137."

**The Production Reality**:
"Under normal load: uses 400 megabytes. Well within request and limit.

Traffic spike: climbs to 800 megabytes. Still fine—between request (512) and limit (1024).

Memory leak or actual spike to 1.1 gigabytes? Kubernetes kills it. Instantly. No negotiation."

**Rhetorical Question #1**:
"So why not just set limits really high and avoid OOMKills? Because you'll overcommit nodes, waste money, and create the noisy neighbor problem. We'll get to that."

---

### 4. How It Works: Scheduling vs Enforcement (4 min)

**The Scheduler's Job** (1.5 min):
"When you deploy a pod with resource requests, here's what happens:

Step 1: Kubernetes scheduler looks at all nodes.
Step 2: For each node, calculates: Total capacity minus already-requested resources equals available.
Step 3: Finds a node where available is greater than or equal to your request.
Step 4: Schedules pod on that node.

**Concrete Example**:
Node has 8 gigabytes total memory.
Existing pods requested: 5 gigabytes.
Your pod requests: 2 gigabytes.
Math: 8 minus 5 equals 3 gigabytes available. Your 2 gigabyte request fits. Scheduled.

But here's the gotcha: The node might only have 1 gigabyte ACTUALLY FREE right now. Because requests are guarantees, not actual usage. This is overcommitment—and it's intentional."

**The Runtime's Job** (1.5 min):
"Limits are enforced by the container runtime—containerd, CRI-O, whatever you're using.

Every container gets a Linux cgroup. The cgroup has memory limits configured. When your process tries to allocate memory beyond the limit, the OOMKiller steps in.

**Think-Aloud - What Actually Happens**:
"Let's walk through an OOMKill:

Your pod is running, using 800 megabytes.
Application gets a burst of traffic. Tries to allocate another 300 megabytes.
Total: 800 plus 300 equals 1.1 gigabytes.
Limit: 1 gigabyte.
Kernel checks: Attempted 1.1 gigabytes exceeds limit 1.0 gigabytes.
Kernel invokes OOMKiller. Sends SIGKILL (signal 9).
Exit code: 128 plus 9 equals 137.
Pod status: OOMKilled.

Kubernetes sees the failure. Restart policy: Always. Starts a new pod. If the problem persists? CrashLoopBackOff."

**The Overcommitment Reality** (1 min):
"Here's what trips people up. Nodes can be overcommitted on requests but NOT on limits.

**Concrete scenario**:
Node: 8 gigabytes memory.
Three pods, each requesting 2 gigabytes, limiting 4 gigabytes.
Total requests: 6 gigabytes. Fits on node.
Total limits: 12 gigabytes. Doesn't fit.

This is fine. Most pods don't hit their limits. But if ALL THREE pods spike to their limits simultaneously? Node runs out of memory. Kernel starts killing pods. Production outage.

This is why right-sizing matters. This is why monitoring matters. This is why Quality of Service classes exist."

---

### 5. Real-World Debugging Workflow (3 min)

**War Story #1 - The E-Commerce OOMKilled Cascade**:
"Real incident, twenty twenty-four. Black Friday. E-commerce company. Traffic spiking.

Three AM: Pager goes off. API pods OOMKilling in a cascade. One dies, others get more traffic, they spike, they die. Repeat.

Engineer SSH's in. Panicking. Let's walk through the systematic workflow I wish they'd followed."

**The Five-Step Debugging Workflow**:

**Step 1: Identify the symptom** (20 sec):
```bash
kubectl get pods -n production
```
Output: `api-deployment-7f6b8c9d4-x7k2m   0/1   OOMKilled   3   5m`

Exit code 137. Memory issue confirmed."

**Step 2: Check the events** (20 sec):
```bash
kubectl describe pod api-deployment-7f6b8c9d4-x7k2m -n production
```
Events show: `OOMKilled: Container exceeded memory limit (1073741824 bytes)`

Translation: Hit 1 gigabyte limit. But was the limit too low or is there a memory leak?"

**Step 3: Check actual usage patterns** (30 sec):
```bash
kubectl top pod api-deployment-7f6b8c9d4-x7k2m -n production
```
Shows current usage (if pod is still running). But we need historical data.

Check Prometheus/monitoring:
`container_memory_usage_bytes{pod="api-deployment-7f6b8c9d4-x7k2m"}`

Graph shows: Normal 600 megabytes. Spikes to 1.2 gigabytes under load."

**Step 4: Analyze the configuration** (30 sec):
```bash
kubectl get pod api-deployment-7f6b8c9d4-x7k2m -o yaml | grep -A 10 resources
```
Shows:
```yaml
requests:
  memory: 256Mi
limits:
  memory: 1Gi
```

Problem identified: Limit is 1 gigabyte. Normal usage 600 megabytes leaves only 400 megabyte headroom. Traffic spike exceeds that."

**Step 5: Determine root cause and fix** (30 sec):
"Two possibilities:
1. Limit too low for legitimate traffic spikes → Increase limit
2. Memory leak in application → Fix application code

In this case: Legitimate traffic spike. Fix:
```yaml
requests:
  memory: 512Mi  # Increased for better scheduling
limits:
  memory: 2Gi    # Increased for headroom
```

Deploy. Monitor. Problem solved."

**Active Recall Prompt #2**:
"Pause here. Before I show you Quality of Service classes, how would YOU debug a pod that's in OOMKilled status right now?

[PAUSE 5 seconds]

Remember: get pods, describe pod, check events, check monitoring for usage patterns, check YAML for configuration, determine if limit is too low or if there's a leak."

### 6. Quality of Service (QoS) Classes (2.5 min)

**Why QoS Exists**:
"When a node runs out of memory, Kubernetes has to decide which pods to kill. It uses Quality of Service classes.

Three classes: Guaranteed, Burstable, BestEffort."

**Class 1: Guaranteed** (45 sec):
"When: Requests equal limits for BOTH memory and CPU.
```yaml
requests:
  memory: 1Gi
  cpu: 500m
limits:
  memory: 1Gi
  cpu: 500m
```

Behavior: Last to be killed during node memory pressure. These are your critical workloads.

Use for: Databases, payment processing, anything that absolutely cannot tolerate OOMKills."

**Class 2: Burstable** (45 sec):
"When: Requests are less than limits.
```yaml
requests:
  memory: 512Mi
limits:
  memory: 2Gi
```

Behavior: Killed before Guaranteed but after BestEffort. Most common class.

Use for: Most application workloads. They can burst when needed but have a safety limit."

**Class 3: BestEffort** (45 sec):
"When: No requests or limits set at all.

Behavior: First to be killed during node memory pressure. Kubernetes makes no promises.

Use for: Batch jobs, non-critical background tasks, things that can tolerate interruption.

Pro tip: Almost never use this in production. It's asking for trouble."

**The Eviction Priority**:
"Node runs out of memory. Kubernetes kills pods in this order:
1. BestEffort pods (no guarantees, first to go)
2. Burstable pods exceeding requests (using more than guaranteed)
3. Burstable pods within requests
4. Guaranteed pods (last resort)

This is why setting requests and limits matters. It's not just resource allocation—it's survival priority during outages."

---

### 7. Right-Sizing Strategy (2 min)

**The Problem**:
"Set requests/limits too low? OOMKills.
Set them too high? Wasted resources, higher costs, poor node utilization.

We need to right-size."

**Three-Step Right-Sizing Process**:

**Step 1: Measure current usage** (30 sec):
"Run in production for a week. Monitor actual memory and CPU usage.
- P50 (median): Typical load
- P95: High load, not peak
- P99: Peak load, rare spikes

Example metrics:
- P50: 400 megabytes
- P95: 800 megabytes
- P99: 1.2 gigabytes"

**Step 2: Set requests at P50-P75, limits at P95-P99** (45 sec):
"Requests: Set at typical load (P50-P75). This ensures good scheduling without over-requesting.
Limits: Set at high load with headroom (P95-P99 plus 20-30%).

From our example:
- Request: 512 megabytes (P75-ish)
- Limit: 1.5 gigabytes (P99 plus headroom)

This allows normal bursting while preventing runaway memory consumption."

**Step 3: Load test and validate** (45 sec):
"Before deploying to production, load test:
```bash
# Simulate 3x expected traffic
hey -n 100000 -c 100 https://api.example.com/endpoint
```

Monitor memory usage during test. Does it stay within limits? Good. Does it OOMKill? Increase limits and retest.

Critical: Test with REALISTIC traffic patterns. Bursts, not constant load."

**War Story #2 - The Cost of Over-Provisioning**:
"Startup, twenty pods, each requesting 4 gigabytes. Actual usage? 800 megabytes average.

They're paying for 80 gigabytes requested. Actually using 16 gigabytes. Wasting $2,400/month on unused capacity.

Right-sizing to 1 gigabyte requests, 2 gigabyte limits? Same performance, $1,800/month savings. At scale, this adds up."

---

### 8. Common Mistakes (1.5 min)

**Mistake 1: Setting requests equal to limits for everything** (30 sec):
"Why it fails: You lose burstability. Everything is Guaranteed QoS. Wastes resources because most workloads don't need their limits constantly.

Fix: Use Burstable for most workloads. Requests at typical usage, limits at peak plus headroom."

**Mistake 2: No limits at all** (30 sec):
"Why it fails: One memory leak brings down the entire node.

Concrete example: Background worker has a bug. Memory climbs: 1 gigabyte, 2 gigabytes, 4 gigabytes, 8 gigabytes. Consumes entire node. Fourteen other pods on that node start failing.

Fix: Always set limits. Even if generous, they're a safety net."

**Mistake 3: Not monitoring actual usage before setting values** (30 sec):
"Why it fails: You're guessing. Either too low (OOMKills) or too high (wasted money).

Fix: Deploy with conservative estimates, monitor for a week, adjust based on actual P95/P99 data."

---

### 9. Active Recall Moment #3 (1 min)

**Retrieval Prompts**:
"Pause and answer these without looking back:

1. What's the difference between requests and limits? One sentence each.
2. A pod has requests 512 megabytes, limits 1 gigabyte. It's using 750 megabytes. What QoS class?
3. A node runs out of memory. What order are pods killed?

[PAUSE 5 seconds]

Answers:
1. Requests: Scheduler uses them to decide which node has capacity. Limits: Runtime enforces them to prevent runaway resource consumption.
2. Burstable—requests are less than limits.
3. BestEffort first, then Burstable exceeding requests, then Burstable within requests, finally Guaranteed."

---

### 10. Recap & Synthesis (1.5 min)

**Key Takeaways**:
"Let's recap what we covered:

1. **Requests vs limits**: Requests are for scheduling, limits are for enforcement. Two different systems, two different jobs.

2. **The hotel analogy**: Requests reserve the room, limits enforce the fire code.

3. **OOMKilled debugging workflow**: Five steps—get pods, describe pod, check events, check monitoring, analyze config, determine root cause.

4. **QoS classes**: Guaranteed (requests equal limits), Burstable (requests less than limits), BestEffort (none set). Determines eviction priority.

5. **Right-sizing formula**: Requests at P50-P75, limits at P95-P99 plus twenty to thirty percent headroom. Validate with load testing.

6. **War stories**: Ninety-four thousand dollars from missing limits. Twenty-four hundred dollars per month wasted from over-provisioning."

**Connection to Episode 1**:
"Remember the production readiness checklist from Episode 1? Resource limits and requests—item number one. Now you understand WHY. It's not just a checkbox. It's the difference between stable production and three AM pages."

**Spaced Repetition Callback**:
"We'll revisit these concepts in Episode 8 when we cover cost optimization. Right-sizing isn't just about stability—it's also about money. And in Episode 4, we'll use this debugging workflow to troubleshoot CrashLoopBackOff issues."

### 11. Next Episode Preview (30 sec)

"Next up: Episode 3 - Security Foundations: RBAC and Secrets.

You'll learn:
- Why RBAC misconfigurations are the number one Kubernetes security issue in twenty twenty-five
- How to implement least privilege roles that actually work in production

## Notes for Script Writing

**CRITICAL Engagement Directives**:

1. **Sentence Length Variation** - MANDATORY:
   - Short: "That's it." "Exit code 137." "Period."
   - Medium: "Requests are for scheduling, limits are for enforcement."
   - Long: "Your pod is running at 800 megabytes, application gets traffic burst, tries to allocate another 300 megabytes, total reaches 1.1 gigabytes, exceeds the 1 gigabyte limit, kernel invokes OOMKiller, pod dies."

2. **Numbers Make It Real**:
   - Always specific: "512 megabytes" not "some memory"
   - Always show stakes: "$2,400/month" not "significant cost"
   - Always show scale: "P95: 800 megabytes" not "typical usage"

3. **War Stories Create Memorability**:
   - Setup: Black Friday, traffic spiking, pods cascading
   - Conflict: OOMKills spreading across cluster
   - Stakes: Revenue loss, engineer panicking at 3 AM
   - Resolution: Systematic debugging reveals low limits

4. **Pacing**:
   - Technical depth with conversational energy
   - Build tension in war stories, release with fixes
   - Vary between explanation, example, workflow, recap

5. **Voice**:
   - "Here's the thing", "Let's be honest", "Here's the reality"
   - Not: "One should configure", "It is recommended that"

**Time Management**:
Target: 15 minutes. Current outline: ~15.5 min. Script writer should tighten transitions slightly.
