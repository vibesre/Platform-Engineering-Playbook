## About CoreDNS

CoreDNS is a flexible, extensible DNS server that serves as the **default DNS provider for Kubernetes clusters**. Built on a plugin architecture, it handles service discovery, external DNS resolution, and custom DNS policies.

Every time a pod looks up a service by name, every time your application resolves `cluster.local`, every time `kubectl exec` needs to find a pod - CoreDNS handles that resolution.

## Topics Deep-Dive

### Plugin Architecture
CoreDNS processes DNS requests through a chain of plugins. Each plugin either handles the request, modifies it, or passes it to the next plugin. This composable design lets you build exactly the DNS server you need.

### Kubernetes Integration
The `kubernetes` plugin enables service discovery in Kubernetes clusters:
- Resolves `service.namespace.svc.cluster.local` to ClusterIP
- Handles headless services with individual pod IPs
- Supports endpoint slices for large deployments
- Configurable pod verification modes

### Essential Plugins Covered

**forward**: Route queries to upstream DNS servers
- Protocol support: DNS, DNS over TLS, DNS over gRPC
- Health checking with automatic failover
- Load balancing policies (round_robin, random, sequential)

**cache**: Response caching for performance
- Configurable TTL and cache size
- Prefetch for frequently requested records
- Denial caching for NXDOMAIN responses

**metrics**: Prometheus integration
- Query latency histograms
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Response codes by zone

**rewrite**: Query modification
- Rewrite names, types, classes
- Pattern matching with regular expressions
- Response rewriting

### DNS Security
- **DNSSEC**: Sign zones and validate responses
- **DNS over TLS**: Encrypted queries to upstream servers (port 853)
- **DNS over HTTPS**: HTTPS-based DNS resolution
- **ACLs**: Filter queries by source IP

## Key Takeaways

1. **Plugin order matters** - CoreDNS executes plugins in the order they're defined in the Corefile

2. **One Corefile, multiple servers** - Use different server blocks for different zones and ports

3. **kubernetes plugin is usually first** - In Kubernetes deployments, handle cluster DNS before forwarding to upstream

4. **Cache wisely** - Caching improves performance but can cause stale data issues; tune TTLs appropriately

5. **Monitor with Prometheus** - The metrics plugin provides visibility into DNS health and performance

6. **Test configuration changes** - Use `coredns -conf Corefile -dns.port 5553` to test before deploying
