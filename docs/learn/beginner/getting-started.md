**Time to Complete**: ‚è±Ô∏è 30 min read

## What is Platform Engineering?

Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud-native era. Platform engineers provide an integrated product most often referred to as an "Internal Developer Platform" covering the operational necessities of the entire lifecycle of applications.

## Platform Engineering vs Related Roles

### Platform Engineer vs SRE vs DevOps

| Aspect | Platform Engineer | SRE | DevOps Engineer |
|--------|------------------|-----|-----------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Building internal platforms | Reliability & operations | CI/CD & automation |
| **Key Metric** | Developer productivity | SLOs & error budgets | Deployment frequency |
| **Approach** | Product mindset | Software engineering for ops | Culture & collaboration |
| **Customers** | Internal developers | End users | Development teams |

### When Companies Use Which Role

- **Startups**: Often combine all three into "DevOps Engineer"
- **Mid-size**: Separate DevOps and SRE roles
- **Enterprise**: Distinct Platform, SRE, and DevOps teams
- **Tech Giants**: Specialized roles with clear boundaries
