## Study Tips

1. **Hands-on Practice**: Don't just read - type every command
2. **Build Projects**: Create small tools as you learn
3. **Take Notes**: Document commands you find useful
4. **Ask Questions**: Join communities when stuck
5. **Be Patient**: Everyone starts somewhere!

## Skills Checklist

By the end of this section, you should be able to:

- [ ] Explain what Platform Engineering is and how it differs from related roles
- [ ] Navigate Linux systems confidently
- [ ] Write basic shell scripts
- [ ] Create Python scripts for automation
- [ ] Understand basic Go syntax
- [ ] Work with APIs and data structures
- [ ] Set up a development environment

## Common Challenges

### "I'm overwhelmed by all the commands!"
Start with the essentials. You don't need to memorize everything - build muscle memory through practice.

### "Programming seems difficult"
Begin with simple scripts. Automate one small task at a time. Complexity comes with experience.

### "I don't have a Linux machine"
- Use WSL2 on Windows
- Use a VM with VirtualBox
- Try cloud platforms' free tiers
- Use online environments like Katacoda

## Next Steps

After completing all beginner topics:
1. Move to [Intermediate Topics](../intermediate/)
2. Start building a portfolio project
3. Contribute to open-source projects
4. Join Platform Engineering communities
