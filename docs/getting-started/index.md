# Getting Started with Platform Engineering

Welcome to your journey into Platform Engineering! This section will introduce you to the fundamental concepts and help you understand what platform engineering is all about.

## What is Platform Engineering?

Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud-native era. Platform engineers create the foundation that development teams build upon.

## Your Learning Path

### 1. Understanding the Role
- What platform engineers do day-to-day
- Key responsibilities and expectations
- How it differs from DevOps and SRE

### 2. Essential Concepts
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Container orchestration
- Cloud-native architecture
- CI/CD pipelines

### 3. Core Technologies
Get familiar with the tools of the trade:
- **Containers**: Docker, containerd
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, GCP, Azure
- **IaC Tools**: Terraform, Ansible
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions

## Prerequisites

Before diving deep, ensure you have:
- Basic understanding of Linux/Unix systems
- Familiarity with at least one programming language
- Understanding of networking fundamentals
- Comfort with command-line interfaces

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Start Here**: Read through the introduction
2. **Build Foundation**: Move to Core Skills section
3. **Go Deeper**: Explore Platform Engineering topics
4. **Practice**: Use hands-on labs
5. **Prepare**: Review interview prep materials

## Quick Wins

Start with these to get immediate value:
- Set up a local development environment
- Deploy your first container
- Create a simple CI/CD pipeline
- Provision cloud resources with Terraform

## Community and Support
