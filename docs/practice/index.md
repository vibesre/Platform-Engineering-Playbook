# 💪 Practice & Prepare

<GitHubButtons />
Welcome to the practice section! This is where you'll apply what you've learned through hands-on labs, mock interviews, and real-world scenarios.

## What's Inside

### 🧪 [Hands-On Labs](hands-on-labs)
Real projects to build your skills:
- Build a Kubernetes cluster from scratch
- Create a complete CI/CD pipeline
- Implement a monitoring stack
- Practice disaster recovery

### 📋 [Interview Format Guides](interview-formats)
Master each interview type:
- Coding interview strategies
- System design methodology
- Behavioral interview framework
- Take-home project tips

### 🎭 [Mock Interview Scenarios](mock-scenarios)
Practice with realistic scenarios:
- Production outage simulations
- Architecture review sessions
- Code review exercises
- Team conflict resolutions

## How to Use This Section

### For Interview Preparation
1. Review the interview format guides
2. Practice with mock scenarios
3. Time yourself to simulate real conditions
4. Get feedback from peers or mentors

### For Skill Building
1. Complete hands-on labs in order
2. Try to solve problems before looking at solutions
3. Experiment with variations
4. Document your learnings

## Practice Schedule

### Daily Practice (30-60 minutes)
- **Monday**: Coding challenges
- **Tuesday**: System design
- **Wednesday**: Troubleshooting scenarios
- **Thursday**: Infrastructure automation
- **Friday**: Mock interviews

### Weekly Projects
- **Week 1**: Set up local Kubernetes
- **Week 2**: Build CI/CD pipeline
- **Week 3**: Implement monitoring
- **Week 4**: Practice disaster recovery

## Success Tips

### 🎯 Be Consistent
- Practice daily, even if just 30 minutes
- Focus on understanding, not memorization
- Track your progress

### 🔄 Iterate and Improve
- Review your solutions
- Learn from mistakes
- Refactor and optimize

### 👥 Get Feedback
- Join study groups
- Practice with peers
- Share solutions for review

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### In Practice
- ❌ Copying solutions without understanding
- ❌ Skipping error handling
- ❌ Ignoring edge cases
- ❌ Not testing your code

### In Interviews
- ❌ Jumping to code too quickly
- ❌ Not asking clarifying questions
- ❌ Overengineering solutions
- ❌ Poor communication

## Resources for Practice

### Online Platforms
- **LeetCode**: Algorithm practice
- **System Design Primer**: Architecture practice
- **Pramp**: Mock interviews
- **Exercism**: Programming exercises

### Local Setup
```bash
# Create practice environment
mkdir ~/platform-practice
cd ~/platform-practice

# Set up Git repository
git init
echo "# Platform Engineering Practice" > README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Create project structure
mkdir -p {labs,interviews,projects,notes}
```
