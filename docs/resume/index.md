# Resume Preparation Guide

Your resume is often the first impression you make. For Platform Engineering/SRE/DevOps roles, it needs to demonstrate both technical depth and operational impact.

## Resume Structure

### Recommended Format
1. **Contact Information** (Name, Email, LinkedIn, GitHub)
2. **Professional Summary** (2-3 lines)
3. **Technical Skills** (Categorized)
4. **Professional Experience** (Reverse chronological)
5. **Education**
6. **Certifications** (If relevant)
7. **Notable Projects** (Optional)

## Key Principles

### 1. One Page Rule
- Keep it to one page unless you have 10+ years of experience
- Be concise and impactful
- Remove outdated or irrelevant information

### 2. Quantify Everything
Instead of: "Improved system performance"  
Write: "Reduced API response time by 40% through caching optimization, serving 2M+ daily requests"

### 3. Action-Oriented Language
Start bullets with strong action verbs:
- Architected, Automated, Built, Deployed
- Designed, Developed, Enhanced, Implemented  
- Migrated, Optimized, Reduced, Scaled

### 4. Demonstrate Progression
Show career growth through increasing responsibilities and impact

## Technical Skills Section

### Effective Organization

```
Technical Skills:
• Cloud Platforms: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, EKS), GCP (GCE, GKE, Cloud Run)
• Containers/Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Istio
• IaC/Configuration: Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation, Packer
• CI/CD: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, CircleCI
• Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog, New Relic
• Languages: Python, Go, Bash, JavaScript, Java
• Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB
```

### What to Include
- List technologies you're proficient in
- Group by category for readability
- Include version numbers for critical tools (e.g., Kubernetes 1.28+)
- Add cloud certifications in skills or separate section

## Experience Section Best Practices

### Structure Each Role

```
Senior DevOps Engineer | TechCorp Inc. | San Francisco, CA | Jan 2022 - Present
• [Achievement with quantified impact]
• [Technical implementation with business value]
• [Process improvement with measurable results]
• [Leadership or collaboration example]
```

### Platform Engineering Examples

**Infrastructure Automation:**
- "Architected multi-region Kubernetes platform serving 50+ microservices with 99.95% uptime SLA"
- "Automated infrastructure provisioning reducing deployment time from 2 hours to 10 minutes"
- "Built self-service platform reducing developer onboarding from 3 days to 2 hours"

**Cost Optimization:**
- "Reduced AWS costs by 35% ($500K annually) through reserved instances and spot fleet optimization"
- "Implemented automated resource scaling saving $200K/year while maintaining performance"

**Reliability Improvements:**
- "Decreased MTTR by 60% implementing comprehensive monitoring and alerting system"
- "Achieved 99.99% uptime for critical services through chaos engineering practices"
- "Reduced production incidents by 75% through improved CI/CD pipelines and testing"

**Security & Compliance:**
- "Implemented zero-trust security model across 100+ services"
- "Achieved SOC2 compliance through automated security controls"
- "Reduced security vulnerabilities by 90% with automated scanning in CI/CD"

## Tailoring for Different Roles

### SRE Focus
- Emphasize reliability metrics (uptime, MTTR, error budgets)
- Highlight incident management experience
- Show capacity planning and performance optimization
- Include on-call experience and runbook creation

### Platform Engineer Focus
- Developer experience improvements
- Self-service platform features
- Tool development and automation
- API and interface design

### DevOps Engineer Focus
- CI/CD pipeline improvements
- Deployment automation
- Cross-team collaboration
- Process improvements

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Listing Responsibilities Instead of Achievements
❌ "Responsible for managing Kubernetes clusters"  
✅ "Managed 5 production Kubernetes clusters serving 10M daily requests with 99.9% availability"

### 2. Being Too Generic
❌ "Worked with cloud technologies"  
✅ "Migrated 50+ applications from on-premise to AWS EKS, reducing infrastructure costs by 40%"

### 3. Ignoring Business Impact
❌ "Implemented monitoring system"  
✅ "Implemented Prometheus-based monitoring, reducing incident detection time from 15 to 2 minutes, preventing $2M in potential downtime losses"

### 4. Overloading with Acronyms
Balance technical terms with clear explanations of impact

## ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Optimization

### Keywords to Include
Match keywords from job descriptions:
- Specific technologies (Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS)
- Methodologies (Agile, DevOps, SRE)
- Skills (automation, scripting, monitoring)
- Certifications (CKA, AWS Solutions Architect)

### Formatting for ATS
- Use standard section headers
- Avoid graphics, tables, or unusual formatting
- Save as PDF and .docx
- Use standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)

## Professional Summary Examples

### Entry-Level (0-2 years)
"Certified AWS Solutions Architect with 2 years of experience automating cloud infrastructure and improving deployment processes. Skilled in Kubernetes, Terraform, and Python scripting. Reduced deployment time by 50% through CI/CD implementation."

### Mid-Level (3-5 years)
"DevOps Engineer with 5 years of experience building scalable cloud platforms. Expert in Kubernetes orchestration, Infrastructure as Code, and monitoring solutions. Led migration of 100+ microservices to AWS EKS, improving reliability to 99.95% uptime."

### Senior-Level (5+ years)
"Senior SRE with 8+ years architecting reliable distributed systems at scale. Specialized in platform engineering, chaos engineering, and cost optimization. Built platforms processing 1B+ daily transactions while reducing operational costs by 40%."

## Project Section (Optional)

Include if you have notable open-source contributions or side projects:

```
