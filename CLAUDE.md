## Blog Content Production Guidelines

### Research Standards

**CRITICAL**: All blog posts must be thoroughly researched and fact-checked before publication. The Platform Engineering Playbook's reputation depends on accuracy and trustworthiness.

#### 1. Source Verification (REQUIRED)

**Primary Sources** (Always prefer these):
- Official documentation from vendors/projects
- Published research papers and studies (with DOI/URL)
- Company engineering blogs from practitioners
- Conference talks from engineers (not sales pitches)
- GitHub repositories with real usage data (stars, forks, contributors)
- Peer-reviewed technical publications

**Acceptable Secondary Sources**:
- Reputable tech news sites (The New Stack, InfoQ, Ars Technica)
- Industry analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester) - cite specific reports with dates
- High-quality community blogs with technical depth
- Stack Overflow/Reddit threads for community sentiment (mark as anecdotal)

**Unacceptable Sources**:
- Marketing content without technical backing
- Unverified claims or rumors
- Outdated content (>2 years old unless historical context)

- Anonymous sources without corroboration

#### 2. Fact-Checking Process

Before publishing, verify EVERY:
- [ ] **Statistic** - Find original source, check date, verify context
- [ ] **Quote** - Confirm exact wording, verify attribution, include context
- [ ] **Technical claim** - Test if possible, or find multiple confirming sources
- [ ] **Pricing** - Check vendor website, note date (pricing changes frequently)
- [ ] **Feature availability** - Verify in current documentation
- [ ] **Company data** - Cross-reference multiple sources (funding, headcount, etc.)

**Verification Rules**:
1. **Numbers require sources**: Every statistic MUST have a source link
2. **Three-source rule**: Major claims need 3+ independent sources
3. **Recency check**: Data >1 year old must be marked with date
4. **Original source**: Always link to the PRIMARY source, not secondary reporting
5. **Archive important sources**: Use archive.org for content that might disappear

#### 3. Citation Format

**Inline Citations** (preferred for stats):
```markdown
According to Gartner's 2024 Platform Engineering Report, 75% of organizations cite cost as a primary concern ([source](url)).
```

**Comparison Tables** (must include sources):
```markdown
| Feature | Tool A | Tool B | Source |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| Price | $99/mo | $149/mo | [Tool A Pricing](url), [Tool B Pricing](url) |
```

**Reference Section** (at end of post):
```markdown

- **Use subheadings every 300-400 words**: Help readers scan and find value
- **Include visuals**: Comparison tables, decision trees, cost breakdowns
- **Add Key Takeaways**: 💡 boxes every 800-1000 words
- **Use specifics over generics**: "Reduced deployment time from 45min to 6min" not "improved deployment speed"
- **Address reader directly**: "You're probably facing..." not "Organizations face..."

**Avoid These Engagement Killers**:
- ❌ Walls of text without breaks
- ❌ Abstract concepts without concrete examples
- ❌ Jargon without explanation
- ❌ Repeating the same points
- ❌ Burying the lede (put valuable info early)

## 📖 Storytelling Framework for Podcast Scripts

**CRITICAL**: Before writing any podcast script, you MUST first create a narrative outline that establishes a compelling story arc. Technical content without narrative structure becomes a list of facts. Great podcasts teach through stories.

### Phase 1: Story Planning (MANDATORY First Step)

**Before writing dialogue, answer these questions:**

1. **What's the Central Tension?**
   - What problem/dilemma does the listener care about?
   - What's at stake? (Money, time, career, team effectiveness)
   - What makes this urgent NOW?

2. **What's the Journey?**
   - Where are we starting? (Current state, common belief)
   - What discoveries do we make along the way?
   - Where do we end up? (New understanding, decision framework)

3. **What's the Emotional Arc?**
   - Start: Recognition ("I've seen this problem")
   - Middle: Discovery/Surprise ("Wait, THAT's why?")
   - End: Empowerment ("Now I know what to do")

4. **What's the Throughline?**
   - One sentence that captures the episode's narrative journey
   - Example: "From thinking PaaS is 'too expensive' to understanding the real cost equation"
   - Example: "From drowning in AI governance to discovering the counterintuitive approach that actually works"

### Story Structure Templates

Choose one of these proven narrative structures before writing:

#### 1. **The Mystery/Discovery Structure**
- **Hook**: Present a puzzling situation or surprising fact
- **Investigation**: Explore the evidence, test assumptions
- **Revelation**: Uncover the real explanation
- **Application**: How to use this insight
- **Best for**: Technical deep-dives, comparing technologies

**Example Outline**:
```
Hook: "Everyone says Kubernetes is overkill for small teams, but companies with 5 engineers are adopting it. Why?"
Investigation: Look at what problems they're actually solving
Revelation: It's not about scale, it's about standardization and hiring
Application: Decision framework based on team composition, not size
```

#### 2. **The Before/After Transformation**
- **Before State**: Common approach/belief and its problems
- **Catalyst**: What forces change (incident, cost, growth)
- **Journey**: What the transition looks like in practice
- **After State**: New reality and specific outcomes
- **Best for**: Platform engineering practices, organizational change

**Example Outline**:
```
Before: Manual deployments, hero culture, knowledge silos
Catalyst: Key engineer leaves, 3-day outage from tribal knowledge
Journey: Painful process of documentation, automation, standardization
After: 10x deployment frequency, reduced MTTR, team can take vacations
```

#### 3. **The Economic Detective Story**
- **Apparent Cost**: Surface-level pricing comparison
- **Hidden Costs**: Uncover what's not on the pricing page
- **Real Calculation**: Build complete TCO model
- **Surprising Conclusion**: Often opposite of initial assumption
- **Best for**: PaaS comparisons, build vs buy decisions

**Example Outline**:
```
Apparent: "$397/month vs free AWS? That's crazy expensive"
Hidden: Engineering time, on-call burden, opportunity cost
Real Calculation: $397 vs $15K/month in team time
Surprising: The "expensive" option saves $175K/year
```

#### 4. **The Skills Evolution Arc**
- **What Was Essential**: Technologies/skills that mattered 2-3 years ago
- **What Changed**: Market shift, technology maturation, new problems
- **What's Emerging**: Skills gaining importance now
- **Strategic Positioning**: How to adapt your learning/hiring
- **Best for**: Career guidance, team building, technology trends

**Example Outline**:
```
Was: Deep Kubernetes expertise, custom observability stacks
Changed: Managed services matured, AI workloads emerged
Emerging: AI platform engineering, cost optimization, security automation
Strategy: Upskill existing team vs hire specialists vs partner/buy
```

#### 5. **The Contrarian Take**
- **Conventional Wisdom**: What "everyone knows" to be true
- **Counter-Evidence**: Data/stories that don't fit the narrative
- **Alternative Explanation**: A different way to see the problem
- **When Each Applies**: Framework for context-specific truth
- **Best for**: Challenging assumptions, nuanced comparisons

**Example Outline**:
```
Conventional: "Microservices are the modern way to build systems"
Counter: 90% of startups would ship faster with a monolith
Alternative: Architecture should match team structure and maturity
Framework: Monolith until X team size/complexity, then split strategically
```

### Narrative Techniques for Technical Content

**1. The Anchoring Statistic**
- Open with a number that challenges assumptions
- Return to it throughout the episode
- Example: "85% of organizations have shadow AI" → becomes recurring theme

**2. The Case Study Arc**
- Introduce a real company's situation (anonymized if needed)
- Follow their decision-making process
- Reveal outcomes (good and bad)
- Extract lessons

**3. The Thought Experiment**
- "Let's design X from first principles"
- Walk through decision points
- Compare to actual market solutions
- Discover why things evolved the way they did

**4. The Historical Context Pattern**
- "Five years ago, we solved this with X"
- "That worked until Y changed"
- "Now we're seeing Z emerge"
- Creates perspective and anticipates future

**5. The Devil's Advocate Dance**
- One speaker presents best case
- Other speaker pokes holes
- First speaker concedes/refines
- Builds nuanced understanding through respectful disagreement

- Empowerment moment: [Where listener thinks "Now I know what to do"]

KEY CALLBACKS:
- [Concept from Act 1 that we return to in Act 3]
- [Running theme that unifies disparate facts]
```

### Quality Checklist for Story-Driven Scripts

Before considering a script complete:

- [ ] **Throughline is clear**: Could you state the episode's journey in one sentence?
- [ ] **Hook is compelling**: Would a listener keep listening after 60 seconds?
- [ ] **Each section builds**: Does each part create momentum toward resolution?
- [ ] **Insights connect**: Do discoveries build on each other vs random facts?
- [ ] **Emotional beats land**: Are there 2-3 moments of recognition/surprise/empowerment?
- [ ] **Callbacks create unity**: Do we return to opening themes/questions?
- [ ] **Payoff satisfies**: Does the ending deliver on the opening promise?
- [ ] **Narrative rhythm**: Does it feel like a story, not a bulleted list?
- [ ] **Technical depth maintained**: Story serves the learning, not replaces it
- [ ] **Listener value clear**: What can they DO differently after listening?

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**❌ The Encyclopedia Entry**
- Just listing facts about technology without narrative
- Fix: Use "mystery" or "economic detective" structure

**❌ The Feature Tour**
- Walking through features without connecting to real problems
- Fix: Use "before/after transformation" with actual pain points

**❌ The Meandering Discussion**
- Topics connected only by being related to same technology
- Fix: Establish throughline and cut anything that doesn't advance it

**❌ The False Debate**
- Creating artificial controversy for engagement
- Fix: Use "contrarian take" only when genuinely nuanced

**❌ The Abandoned Setup**
- Opening with compelling question that never gets answered
- Fix: Outline Act 3 resolution before writing Act 1 hook

### Example: Transforming Facts Into Story

**❌ BEFORE (List of Facts)**:
```
Speaker 1: PaaS platforms are getting popular.
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's talk about pricing. Flightcontrol is $397/month...
Speaker 1: Vercel is $20/month for Pro...
Speaker 2: Railway has pay-as-you-go...
[15 minutes of pricing details]
```

**✅ AFTER (Story Structure - Economic Detective)**:
```
Speaker 1: "A developer asked me: 'How can anyone justify $397/month for Flightcontrol when AWS is free?' It's a fair question. Until you do the actual math."

Speaker 2: "Right, because we're comparing the wrong numbers. The real question isn't $397 vs $0. What are we actually comparing?"

[Act 1: Setup - Establishes mystery of pricing]

Speaker 1: "Let me walk through what happened when we calculated this for a 5-person team..."

[Act 2: Exploration - Uncover hidden costs through case study]

Speaker 2: "So the 'expensive' option saved them $175K per year. That's the part that doesn't show up in pricing pages."

[Act 3: Resolution - Framework for real cost calculation]
```

### Outline Review Process

**MANDATORY**: Before writing full dialogue:

1. **Write the outline** using template above
2. **Test the throughline**: Can you state the journey in one sentence?
3. **Verify emotional beats**: Mark recognition/surprise/empowerment moments
4. **Check building blocks**: Does each section create momentum?
5. **Get feedback** (if possible): "Here's the story arc, does this sound compelling?"
6. **ONLY THEN write dialogue** that brings the outline to life

**Remember**: The outline is your story architecture. Dialogue is the execution. You can't build a compelling episode without first designing the narrative structure.

---

### Episode Structure (12-15 minutes)

**IMPORTANT**: Scripts should NOT include intro/outro - these are handled by separate MP3 files.

**Intro MP3** (podcast-generator/intros/intro.mp3):
- Welcomes listeners to the podcast
- Explains the AI-powered, community-driven format
- Invites contributions via platformengineeringplaybook.com
- Standard intro plays before every episode

**Outro MP3** (podcast-generator/outros/outro.mp3):
- Thanks listeners
- Directs to platformengineeringplaybook.com for content and GitHub
- Encourages ratings and GitHub stars
- Standard outro plays after every episode

**Script Content** (what you write):
1. **Episode Introduction** (30-45s): Direct preview of what the episode covers
   - No "Welcome to the show" or host introductions
   - Start with "Today we're diving into..."
   - Preview 2-3 main topics to be covered
   - Set context for why this matters now
2. **Landscape Overview** (3-4 min): Current state, market dynamics, design philosophy evolution
3. **Technical Deep Dive** (4-5 min): Compare 2-3 solutions from engineering and business perspectives
4. **Underdogs & Specialists** (2-3 min): Niche players, regional leaders, emerging solutions
5. **Skills Evolution** (3-4 min): What's table stakes, losing relevance, rising importance
6. **Practical Wisdom** (2 min): Architectural mistakes, evaluation frameworks, boring tech principle
7. **Closing Thoughts** (1-2 min): Key insight, actionable takeaway
   - No "Thanks for listening" or goodbye messages
   - End with practical takeaway or forward-looking statement
   - Final line should feel conclusive but not like a formal signoff

### Natural Conversation Techniques

- **Building Momentum**: "You mentioned X earlier..." → "Oh yeah, that's a perfect example..."
- **Respectful Disagreement**: "I'm not sure I fully agree..." → "How so?" → Context-specific perspectives
- **Shared Learning**: "Wait, they're doing WHAT...?" → "I know, right? It sounds crazy until..."
- **Technical Storytelling**: Reference real incidents, production failures, architectural decisions

### Always Cover

1. **Design Philosophy**: Original problems and solutions
2. **Evolution**: How they've adapted to changing needs  
3. **Trade-offs**: What you give up for benefits
4. **Operational Reality**: Production experience
5. **Team Impact**: Organizational effects
6. **Future Direction**: Where technology is heading

### Avoid

- Basic explanations, absolute statements, marketing speak
- Installation guides, outdated information
- Focus on features over strategic implications

### Research Sources

- Production postmortems, engineering blogs from scale companies
- GitHub issues, practitioner conference talks (not vendor pitches)
- Job postings, compensation data for skill demand analysis

### Show Branding

**Name**: The Platform Engineering Playbook
**Tagline**: "Where we dissect the technologies, trends, and decisions that shape platform engineering at scale"

**Intro/Outro Handling**:
- **DO NOT** write intro/outro text in scripts - handled by MP3 files
- **Intro MP3 contains**: Welcome, show description, community invitation
- **Outro MP3 contains**: Thanks, website link, GitHub star request

**Script Opening Examples** (CORRECT):
```
✅ Good Example 1:
Speaker 1: Today we're diving into the AI platform engineering crisis that 85% of organizations are facing right now. Shadow AI, governance that actually works, AIOps that delivers real ROI, and how to build platforms that support AI workloads without losing your mind.
Speaker 2: We'll talk about why the "just ban AI tools" approach fails 100% of the time, and what actually works instead. Plus, we'll look at some genuinely impressive AIOps results and what this means for platform engineering careers.

✅ Good Example 2:
Speaker 1: Today we're diving into the twenty twenty-five PaaS landscape. Flightcontrol, Vercel, Railway, Render, Fly dot io—everyone's promising Heroku-like simplicity with cloud-scale performance. But which one actually delivers?
Speaker 2: We'll break down the pricing models, compare real-world costs for the same workload, and give you a decision framework for choosing the right platform for your team size and technical expertise.
```

```
❌ Bad Example (DO NOT DO THIS):
Speaker 2: ...so they deployed GitHub Copilot to 2,000 developers, productivity went up 55%...
Speaker 1: Wait, let me guess - the security team tried to block everything?
Speaker 2: Worse. They blocked the official tools. Classic security theater backfire.
Speaker 1: That's the perfect example of what we're diving into today. Welcome to The Platform Engineering Playbook - I'm Jordan.
Speaker 2: I'm Alex. This is the show where we dissect the technologies...

[This is WRONG - no cold opens, no welcomes, no host introductions!]
```

**Script Closing Examples** (CORRECT):
```
✅ Good Example 1:
Speaker 1: The fundamentals of good engineering remain constant, even as the landscape evolves.
Speaker 2: And that's what matters most - making thoughtful decisions for your teams and staying ahead of the curve.

✅ Good Example 2:
Speaker 2: The fundamentals of good engineering remain constant, even as the landscape evolves. Start with simplicity, prove the value, then scale to control as your needs grow.

✅ Good Example 3:
Speaker 1: Consolidation is coming whether we like it or not. The economics simply don't support 130-tool portfolios anymore. Start with one area, prove the value, and expand from there.
```

```
❌ Bad Example (DO NOT DO THIS):
Speaker 2: The fundamentals of good engineering remain constant, even as the landscape evolves.
Speaker 1: That's what we're here for - cutting through the noise to help you make better decisions for your teams and your career.
Speaker 2: Thanks for tuning in to The Platform Engineering Playbook. Keep building thoughtfully.
Speaker 1: Until next time.

[This is WRONG - the outro MP3 handles all the thanks/goodbye!]
```

**PROHIBITED PHRASES** (these are in intro/outro MP3s - NEVER include in scripts):
- ❌ "Welcome to The Platform Engineering Playbook"
- ❌ "I'm Jordan" / "I'm Alex"
- ❌ "This is the show where we dissect..."
- ❌ "That's what we're here for"
- ❌ "Thanks for tuning in" / "Thanks for listening"
- ❌ "Keep building thoughtfully"
- ❌ "Until next time"
- ❌ Any variation of cold open hooks that drop mid-conversation

**Episode Naming**: "[Technology] - The Real Story Behind [Key Insight]"

**Voice**: Two experienced engineers having a coffee chat about strategic technology decisions

### Script Format & TTS Guidelines

**Raw Script Format** (stored in `docs/podcasts/scripts/`):
```
Jordan: [First speaker's dialogue]
Alex: [Second speaker's dialogue]
Jordan: [Continuation...]
```

**CRITICAL**: Scripts MUST use `Jordan:` and `Alex:` as speaker names, NOT `Speaker 1:` and `Speaker 2:`. The TTS generator maps these names to specific voices:
- `Jordan` → Kore voice (authoritative, slightly slower)
- `Alex` → Algieba voice (energetic, normal speed)

**SSML Pause Tags** (W3C SSML Standard):
- **Available tags in scripts**: `[pause short]`, `[pause]`, `[pause long]`
- **Converts to SSML**:
  - `[pause short]` → `<break strength="weak"/>`
  - `[pause]` → `<break strength="medium"/>`
  - `[pause long]` → `<break strength="strong"/>`
- **Strategic placement** for natural pacing:
  - After statistics/percentages: "increased 890% [pause]"
  - After rhetorical questions: "What's the catch? [pause]"
  - After dramatic reveals: "here's the kicker - [pause]"
  - After contrast words: "But, [pause] there's more"
  - In lists: "First, [pause short] second, [pause short] third"
  - After emphatic statements: "That's transformational. [pause]"
- **Auto-generation**: Use `python3 scripts/add_ssml_tags.py` to batch-add tags
- **Example**: "Team efficiency improved 50%, [pause] but here's the stat that blew my mind - [pause] false positive alerts dropped 96%."
- **Format**: Scripts use simplified `[pause]` syntax; TTS generator converts to proper SSML `<speak>` tags automatically
- Use judiciously - too many pauses sound unnatural

**Why Custom Tags?**
- Easier to read/edit in plain text scripts
- Automatically converted to proper SSML during TTS generation
- All XML characters properly escaped
- Follows Google Cloud Text-to-Speech SSML specification

**Pronunciation Tags** (CRITICAL for Natural TTS):
- **Reference Guide**: `podcast-generator/PRONUNCIATION_GUIDE.md` (comprehensive list)
- **Common Mispronunciations** that MUST be tagged:
  - **Kubernetes** → `<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˌkubɚˈnɛtɪs">Kubernetes</phoneme>` (NOT "koo-ber-NET-eez")
  - **PostgreSQL/Postgres** → `<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈpoʊstɡrɛs">Postgres</phoneme>` (drop the Q-L)
  - **Azure** → `<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈæʒɚ">Azure</phoneme>` ("AZH-er" not "ah-ZOOR")
  - **K8s** → `<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="keɪ eɪts">K8s</phoneme>` ("K eights" not "K eight S")
  - **YAML** → `<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈjæməl">YAML</phoneme>` ("YAM-ul" not "Y-A-M-L")
  - **Nginx** → `<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈɛndʒɪn ˈɛks">Nginx</phoneme>` ("engine-X")
  - **AWS, GCP, API, GPU, CPU, etc.** → Use `<say-as interpret-as="characters">TERM</say-as>`
- **Auto-tagging**: `python3 scripts/add_pronunciation_tags.py` adds tags automatically
- **Testing**: All pronunciation tags tested in `test_ssml_conversion.py`
- **Format**: Tags preserved during SSML conversion (not escaped)

**Example with Pronunciation Tags**:
```
Speaker 1: We're deploying <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˌkubɚˈnɛtɪs">Kubernetes</phoneme> on <say-as interpret-as="characters">AWS</say-as> [pause] with <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈpoʊstɡrɛs">Postgres</phoneme> as our database.
```

**Chunking Rules**:
- Chunks NEVER break within a speaker's segment
- Only chunk at speaker boundaries (Speaker 1 → Speaker 2 transitions)
- Target: 100 words, Max: 200 words per chunk
- Preserves natural conversation flow

**TTS Best Practices** (Google Cloud Neural2):
- Uses proper W3C SSML format with `<speak>`, `<break>`, `<phoneme>`, and `<say-as>` tags
- **CRITICAL**: Chirp3-HD voices DO NOT support SSML - must use Neural2 or WaveNet
- Voices: Jordan (Neural2-J female), Alex (Neural2-D male) - SSML-compatible
- Speaking rates: Jordan 0.95x (authoritative), Alex 1.0x (energetic)
- Pitch adjustment: Jordan -2.0 (slightly lower), Alex 0.0 (normal)
- Sample rate: 24kHz (Neural2 standard)
- Audio profile: `headphone-class-device` (optimized for podcast listening)
- NO speaker names spoken in audio (handled by voice selection)
- All XML special characters automatically escaped

**SSML Tag Management** (CRITICAL - Read Carefully):
- **In source scripts** (`docs/podcasts/scripts/*.txt`): Use simplified `[pause]` tags for readability
- **In episode pages** (`docs/podcasts/*.md`): SSML tags MUST BE stripped (never visible to readers)
- **During TTS generation**: Automatically converted to proper W3C SSML format
- **Conversion process**:
  1. `[pause short]` → `<break strength="weak"/>`
  2. `[pause]` → `<break strength="medium"/>`
  3. `[pause long]` → `<break strength="strong"/>`
  4. All XML special characters (`<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`) are escaped
  5. Wrapped in `<speak>...</speak>` root element
- **Google Cloud TTS API Support**: Fully compliant with W3C SSML specification
  - Supports all break strengths: x-weak, weak, medium, strong, x-strong
  - Characters count toward API limits (including SSML tags)
  - Special characters properly escaped per Google's requirements

**Required for ALL New Scripts**:
1. ✅ Use `[pause]` tags (not raw SSML) in source scripts
2. ✅ Add pause tags strategically (see placement guide above)
3. ✅ Strip pause tags when displaying on episode pages
4. ✅ Test with: `python3 test_ssml_conversion.py`
5. ✅ Validate: `python3 scripts/ssml_utils.py`

**Generation Commands**:
```bash
# Generate podcast audio from script (with SSML tags and intro/outro)
cd podcast-generator
python3 scripts/generate_podcast.py ../docs/podcasts/scripts/episode-name.txt --force

# Add SSML tags to scripts (batch process)
python3 scripts/add_ssml_tags.py ../docs/podcasts/scripts

# Test SSML conversion
python3 test_ssml_conversion.py

# Validate SSML tags in a script
python3 scripts/ssml_utils.py
```

**Workflow for New Podcast Episodes**:
1. Write script in `docs/podcasts/scripts/00XXX-episode-name.txt`
   - Use `Speaker 1:` and `Speaker 2:` format
   - Write naturally without pause/pronunciation tags initially
2. Add pause tags: `python3 scripts/add_ssml_tags.py ../docs/podcasts/scripts --file 00XXX-episode-name.txt`
3. Add pronunciation tags: `python3 scripts/add_pronunciation_tags.py ../docs/podcasts/scripts --file 00XXX-episode-name.txt`
   - See `PRONUNCIATION_GUIDE.md` for full reference
   - Script auto-tags common terms (AWS, Kubernetes, Postgres, etc.)
4. Review and manually adjust:
   - Check pause placement (natural conversation flow)
   - Verify pronunciation tags on ALL technical terms
   - Test specific terms if uncertain
5. Create episode page in `docs/podcasts/episode-name.md`
   - Copy dialogue from script
   - Strip ALL `[pause]` and pronunciation tags before publishing
   - Use `ssml_utils.py` to strip tags automatically
6. Generate audio: `python3 scripts/generate_podcast.py ../docs/podcasts/scripts/00XXX-episode-name.txt`
   - Intro and outro automatically added
   - Pause tags converted to `<break>` SSML
   - Pronunciation tags preserved in SSML
   - All XML characters properly escaped
   - Audio normalized and stitched

**MANDATORY Pronunciation Tags** (Never skip these):
- Kubernetes, K8s, kubectl
- PostgreSQL, Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, Redis
- Azure, Heroku, Vercel, Nginx
- AWS, GCP, API, GPU, CPU, RAM (use say-as)
- YAML, JSON (not XML, HTML, CSS)
- MLOps, AIOps, PaaS, IaaS, SaaS

**Consult `PRONUNCIATION_GUIDE.md` for complete list** (80+ terms documented)
