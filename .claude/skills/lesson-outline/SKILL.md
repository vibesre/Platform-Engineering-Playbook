# Lesson Outline

Create detailed outlines for individual lesson episodes that maximize learning retention through structured teaching frameworks and pedagogical best practices.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User says: "Create lesson outline", "Plan episode structure"
- Curriculum exists (from lesson-curriculum skill)
- Ready to plan specific lesson episode
- Before writing any lesson script

**NEVER write a script without completing an outline first.**

## Core Principle

> **Teaching content without lesson structure = information dump**
>
> **Teaching content WITH lesson structure = effective learning experience**

Great lessons teach through structured frameworks, not random fact delivery.

## Teaching Techniques Integration

### 1. Signposting
**What**: Tell learners what's coming, where they are, where they've been

**Application in Outline**:
```
Introduction: "Today we'll cover X, Y, and Z"
Transition: "Now that we understand X, let's move to Y"
Conclusion: "We covered X, Y, and Z - next time we'll explore W"
```

### 2. Analogies & Metaphors
**What**: Relate new concepts to familiar ideas

**Application in Outline**:
- Note in outline where analogies will be used
- Choose analogies that match learner experience
- Use consistently across episodes

**Example**:
```
Section: Mental Model Introduction
Analogy: "Think of Kubernetes Pods like shipping containers..."
Extend: "Just as containers standardize cargo, Pods standardize deployments"
```

### 3. Elaboration
**What**: Say the same thing multiple ways

**Application in Outline**:
```
Concept Introduction:
- Initial explanation (technical)
- Rephrase: "In other words..."
- Another angle: "To put it another way..."
- Concrete example: "For example, if you..."
```

### 4. Think-Alouds
**What**: Model expert thinking process

**Application in Outline**:
```
Section: Problem-Solving Example
Include: "Here's how I think through this...
  First, I'd check X because...
  Then I'd consider Y...
  Finally, I'd decide based on Z..."
```

### 5. Pause Points
**What**: Moments for learner reflection and practice

**Application in Outline**:
```
After explaining concept:
"Pause here and think: How would YOU solve this?
[PAUSE 3-5 seconds in audio]
Here's how I'd approach it..."
```

### 6. Callbacks
**What**: Reference earlier concepts (spaced repetition)

**Application in Outline**:
```
Note which previous episodes to reference:
"Remember in Episode 2 when we learned [concept]?
This is where that becomes critical..."
```

Before approving this outline:

**Structure**:
- [ ] Clear beginning, middle, end
- [ ] Logical flow (each section builds)
- [ ] Time allocations realistic (total ~15 min)
- [ ] All sections have specific content (not vague placeholders)

**Pedagogy**:
- [ ] Learning objectives specific and measurable
- [ ] Spaced repetition integrated (callbacks planned)
- [ ] Active recall moment(s) included
- [ ] Signposting throughout (transitions clear)
- [ ] At least one analogy or metaphor
- [ ] Common pitfalls addressed

**Content**:
- [ ] Addresses pain points from research
- [ ] Production-relevant examples
- [ ] Decision frameworks (not just facts)
- [ ] Troubleshooting included
- [ ] Appropriate depth for senior engineers

**Engagement**:
- [ ] Strong hook (first 60 seconds compelling)
- [ ] Practice/pause moments included
- [ ] Variety in teaching techniques
- [ ] Preview builds anticipation for next episode

**Dependencies**:
- [ ] Prerequisites clearly stated
- [ ] Builds appropriately on previous episodes
- [ ] Sets foundation for future episodes
- [ ] No knowledge gaps
```

## Outline Quality Standards

### Specific vs Vague

**❌ VAGUE**:
```
Section: Introduction
- Talk about Kubernetes
- Explain why it's important
- Show example
```

**✅ SPECIFIC**:
```
Section: Mental Model Introduction (3 min)
- Analogy: "K8s is like a data center operating system"
- Core abstraction: Desired state vs actual state
- Why declarative > imperative (cite specific production benefit)
- Visual: Picture a thermostat (desired temp vs current temp)
```

### Measurable Objectives

**❌ BAD**:
- Understand Kubernetes Pods
- Learn about deployments
- Know how to use kubectl

**✅ GOOD**:
- Explain the Pod abstraction and why containers alone aren't enough
- Create a Deployment manifest that scales to 5 replicas
- Diagnose why a Pod is in CrashLoopBackOff state using kubectl

### Effective Hooks

**❌ WEAK**:
"Today we're going to learn about Prometheus."

**✅ STRONG**:
"Your monitoring system has 10 million metrics. Your bill just hit $50K/month. Yet when production broke last night, you had no visibility into the actual problem. This is why you need to understand metric cardinality."

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ The Information Dump
**Problem**: Just listing facts without structure or teaching framework

**Fix**: Use template structure, include active learning moments

### ❌ Missing Connections
**Problem**: Content islands - no callbacks to previous or preview of next

**Fix**: Plan spaced repetition callbacks, explicit connections

### ❌ Passive Learning Only
**Problem**: No moments for learner to practice or recall

**Fix**: Include pause points, retrieval practice, self-check questions

### ❌ No Scaffolding
**Problem**: Jumps to complex without building foundation

**Fix**: Progressive reveal - simple → concrete → complex

### ❌ Abstract Only
**Problem**: Concepts explained but never grounded in examples

**Fix**: Every abstract concept needs concrete example

## Instructions for Claude

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Verify curriculum exists**:
   - Check for curriculum-plan.md
   - If missing, tell user to run lesson-curriculum first

2. **Review curriculum for this episode**:
   - Learning objectives
   - Spaced repetition plan
   - Prerequisites
   - Where this fits in overall course

3. **Choose appropriate template**:
   - Foundation → Template 1
   - Core Concept → Template 2
   - Review → Template 3
   - Advanced → Template 4

4. **Fill template with specific content**:
   - Not placeholders - actual teaching content
   - Specific analogies and examples
   - Detailed section breakdowns
   - Time allocations that add to ~15 min

5. **Plan spaced repetition**:
   - What concepts introduced (repeat later)
   - What concepts reinforced (from earlier)
   - Where callbacks occur

6. **Include active learning**:
   - Retrieval practice questions
   - Pause points
   - Practice prompts
   - Self-check moments

7. **Validate against checklist** (all items)

8. **Save outline**:
   `docs/podcasts/courses/[course-slug]/outlines/lesson-[NN]-outline.md`

9. **Present to user**:
   - Summary of outline structure
   - Key teaching techniques used
   - Learning objectives
   - Ask: "Does this outline work? Ready to write script?"

**NEVER proceed to script writing without an approved outline.**

The outline is your teaching architecture. Script is just execution. You can't deliver effective learning without first designing the lesson structure.
