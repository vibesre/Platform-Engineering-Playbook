# Blog Outline

Create structured outlines for blog posts using proven content frameworks, SEO/AEO requirements, and engagement best practices. MANDATORY before writing any blog post.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User says: "Create blog outline for [topic]", "Plan blog post structure"
- Research phase is complete (blog-research skill used)
- Before writing the actual blog post

**Prerequisites**: Research must be complete with sources, keywords, and FAQ questions identified.

## Why Outlines Matter

**Writing without an outline leads to**:
- ❌ Missing critical SEO/AEO elements (FAQ schema, Key Takeaways)
- ❌ Poor flow and organization
- ❌ Forgetting to include sources and citations
- ❌ Weak engagement (no stories, examples, or decision frameworks)
- ❌ Inconsistent tone and depth

**A good outline ensures**:
- ✅ All SEO/AEO requirements planned upfront
- ✅ Logical flow from problem → analysis → solution
- ✅ Strategic placement of Key Takeaways and statistics
- ✅ Engagement elements (stories, examples) positioned
- ✅ Every statistic has a source link
