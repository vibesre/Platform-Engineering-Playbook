Title: The Multi-Region Mental Model: Cost, Complexity, and Capability

Description:
Last month, a SaaS company's AWS bill exploded from $3,848 to $28,858‚Äîa shocking 7.5x increase, not the 2x vendors promise. Before you commit to multi-region, understand the real costs, hidden single points of failure in "multi-region" designs, and when single-region is actually the smarter choice. This lesson introduces the Cost-Complexity-Capability triangle that governs every multi-region decision.

Summary:
‚Ä¢ Multi-region costs 2.5-7.5x more (not 2x): Data transfer is the silent killer at $0.02/GB
‚Ä¢ The Cost-Complexity-Capability triangle: You can optimize for two vertices, never all three
‚Ä¢ Hidden SPOFs exist even in multi-region: Route53, IAM, ACM all depend on US-EAST-1 control planes
‚Ä¢ 80% of companies don't need multi-region: Do the math‚Äî$10M revenue = $1,140/hour downtime cost
‚Ä¢ Engineering time is the largest hidden cost: 500-1000 hours implementation plus ongoing operational complexity
‚Ä¢ Decision framework: Calculate actual downtime cost vs multi-region premium to know if it's worth it
