You've completed fifteen episodes. Aurora Global Database, DynamoDB Global Tables, EKS multi-cluster, network architecture, observability, DNS failover, cost management, CAP theorem, service mesh, disaster recovery, compliance, security, and anti-patterns.

You understand the theory. You know the building blocks. Now the critical question: How do you actually execute this? How do you go from single-region production today to multi-region production in ninety days without causing outages?

Today you're learning the implementation roadmap. Not vague guidance. A concrete phase-by-phase plan with weekly tasks, go-no-go decision criteria, and rollback procedures.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have the complete 90-day timeline. Phase one: Assessment and foundation. Phase two: Data layer migration. Phase three: Compute layer deployment. Phase four: Validation and cutover. Dependencies between tasks. Risk mitigation strategies. When to abort if reality doesn't match plan.

Because knowledge without execution is theoretical. Let's turn fifteen episodes into production reality.

The 90-day timeline has four phases of roughly three weeks each. Each phase has deliverables, validation criteria, and go-no-go gates. If phase validation fails, you don't proceed. You fix issues or abort.

Phase One: Days 1-21, Assessment and Business Foundation.

Week one, days 1-7: Business case development. Use Episode 9's ROI framework. Calculate revenue per hour. Estimate annual outage hours without multi-region. Calculate multi-region incremental cost. Present analysis to business stakeholders. Get written approval or kill project here.

Example calculation for fifty million revenue company: Fifty million equals five thousand seven hundred per hour. Expected outage without multi-region: Eight hours annually equals forty-five thousand six hundred cost. Multi-region incremental cost: Three hundred thousand annually. Breakeven requires sixty-five hours outage. If realistic, proceed. If not, consider alternatives like improved backups or faster recovery procedures.

Deliverable: Approved business case with signatures. Budget allocated. Timeline agreed.

Week two, days 8-14: Architecture design and team planning. Choose pattern from Episode 2. Hot-warm for most cases. Hot-hot only if justified by RTO under one minute. Document architecture diagram. Identify which services replicate, which stay regional. Assign team roles - who owns data layer, compute layer, networking, observability.

Critical decision: Choose secondary region. Episode 5 guidance - same geography for lower latency, different geography for disaster isolation. US-EAST-1 primary? US-WEST-2 secondary for latency or EU-WEST-1 for diversity. Document rationale.

Deliverable: Architecture diagram approved. Team assigned with clear ownership. Secondary region selected.

Week three, days 15-21: Network foundation. Implement cross-region connectivity from Episode 5. VPC Peering for simple architectures, Transit Gateway for complex. Test connectivity with basic EC2 instances in each region. Verify latency matches expectations. Set up VPC endpoints for AWS services in secondary region. Configure security groups for cross-region traffic.

Validation test: Deploy test application in US-EAST-1, test application in US-WEST-2. Verify connectivity. Measure latency. Should match Episode 5 numbers - under 80ms for US cross-region, under 150ms for US-EU.

Deliverable: Network connectivity working. Latency validated. Security groups configured.

Go-no-go gate one: Do you have business approval, architecture design, and working network? If yes, proceed to phase two. If no, do not proceed. You'll waste engineering time and money.

Phase Two: Days 22-49, Data Layer Migration.

Week four, days 22-28: Aurora Global Database setup. Create Aurora cluster in secondary region following Episode 3. Add secondary region to existing primary cluster. Monitor replication lag. Should stabilize under 100ms. If lag exceeds 200ms consistently, investigate before proceeding. Configure read replicas in secondary. Test read queries against secondary.

Critical configuration: Encryption at rest. From Episode 14, choose per-region KMS keys for security or multi-region keys for faster DR. Document decision.

Validation test: Write to primary Aurora. Verify replication to secondary within 100ms. Query secondary read replica. Verify data matches.

Deliverable: Aurora replicating with acceptable lag. Read replicas functional.

Week five, days 29-35: DynamoDB Global Tables if applicable. From Episode 6, identify which tables need active-active writes. Not all tables. User sessions stay regional. Transaction tables, product catalogs, user profiles - these replicate. Enable Global Tables selectively. Monitor replication lag and WCU consumption. From Episode 15 anti-pattern five, watch costs carefully.

Cost checkpoint: Compare actual DynamoDB spend to projected. If actual exceeds projected by 20%, investigate before proceeding. You may have replicated wrong tables.

Deliverable: Selected DynamoDB tables replicating. Costs within projections.

Week six, days 36-42: Backup validation and failover testing for data layer. Take Aurora snapshot in primary. Restore to secondary region. Verify KMS permissions allow decryption. Time the restore process. From Episode 12, this is critical for RTO calculation. Test Aurora promotion without affecting production. Demote immediately after testing.

Validation test: Snapshot restore completes in under 15 minutes. Promotion works. Demotion returns to primary without data loss.

Deliverable: Proven data layer failover procedure. Documented timing. Runbooks written.

Week seven, days 43-49: Data consistency validation. From Episode 10, test eventual consistency patterns. Write to US-EAST-1 DynamoDB. Immediately read from US-WEST-2. Observe replication lag. Design application logic to handle stale reads. Implement version numbers or sticky routing if needed. Verify Aurora read-after-write consistency from primary, eventual consistency from replicas.

Deliverable: Applications designed for eventual consistency. Testing confirms behavior matches expectations.

Go-no-go gate two: Is data replicating reliably with acceptable lag? Can you failover data layer successfully? If yes, proceed. If no, fix data issues before adding compute complexity.

Phase Three: Days 50-70, Compute Layer Deployment.

Week eight, days 50-56: EKS cluster setup in secondary region. From Episode 4, create cluster matching primary configuration. Same instance types, same Kubernetes version, same add-ons. Deploy observability agents from Episode 7. Configure CloudWatch logs shipping, X-Ray daemon. Deploy core infrastructure - ingress controller, service mesh if applicable. Don't deploy applications yet.

Validation test: Deploy simple test pod. Verify logs reach CloudWatch. Verify traces reach X-Ray. Verify pod can query Aurora secondary and DynamoDB.

Deliverable: EKS cluster operational. Observability working. Connectivity to data layer validated.

Week nine, days 57-63: Application deployment to secondary at reduced capacity. Deploy applications using same manifests as primary. Scale to 25% of primary capacity for hot-warm. Monitor pod health, database connections, external API calls. From Episode 4, configure service discovery to resolve to regional endpoints.

Critical: Applications in secondary should NOT receive production traffic yet. Deploy and run healthy, but DNS doesn't route to them.

Validation test: Call application endpoints directly via secondary load balancer. Verify responses. Confirm database queries work. Check error rates match primary region baseline.

Deliverable: Applications running in secondary. Health checks passing. No production traffic.

Week ten, days 64-70: Secrets and configuration replication. From Episode 14, enable Secrets Manager replication for application secrets. Verify secondary region applications can retrieve credentials. Test credential rotation - rotate in primary, verify update propagates to secondary within 60 seconds. Update application health checks to validate secret availability.

Deliverable: Secrets available in both regions. Rotation working.

Go-no-go gate three: Are applications deployed and healthy in secondary? Can they access data and secrets? If yes, proceed to validation phase. If no, troubleshoot before attempting traffic migration.

Phase Four: Days 71-90, Validation and Cutover.

Week eleven, days 71-77: DNS configuration and gradual traffic introduction. Configure Route53 from Episode 8. Set up health checks on primary endpoints. Create failover routing policy with primary and secondary records. Don't enable failover yet. Instead, create weighted routing sending 1% of traffic to secondary. Monitor error rates, latency, database load.

From Episode 8, set TTL to 60 seconds. Monitor secondary scaling. Auto-scaling should handle 1% smoothly. Increase to 5% if no issues. Monitor for 24 hours. Increase to 10% if stable.

Critical: Watch for issues from Episode 15 anti-pattern six. Are you seeing excessive cross-region database calls? High latency? Data transfer costs spiking?

Deliverable: Secondary handling 10% production traffic successfully. Error rates normal. Latency acceptable.

Week twelve, days 78-84: Failover testing with production-like load. Use Route53 weighted routing to send 50% traffic to secondary. Temporarily reduce primary capacity to force secondary auto-scaling. Verify secondary scales from 25% to 100% capacity within RTO. From Episode 12, execute manual failover. Promote Aurora. Update Route53 to point to secondary as primary. Monitor error rates during failover.

Validation test: Failover completes within RTO. Error rates remain below 1%. Aurora promotion works. Applications remain healthy. Rollback to primary after testing.

Deliverable: Proven full failover procedure. RTO validated. Team trained on execution.

Week thirteen, days 85-90: Production cutover and documentation. Enable Route53 failover routing. Primary becomes active with health checks. Secondary becomes standby with automatic failover on health check failure. Document runbooks from Episode 12. Train on-call engineers. Set up chaos engineering schedule from Episode 12. Plan first quarterly DR drill.

Final validation: Trigger health check failure in primary. Verify automatic failover to secondary. Verify RTO meets requirements. Rollback after testing.

Deliverable: Multi-region production live. Automatic failover configured. Team trained. Runbooks complete.

Post-cutover checklist: Days 91-120, operational maturity.

Month four, cost optimization. Review actual costs against Episode 9 projections. Identify optimization opportunities. Right-size secondary capacity. Review DynamoDB table selection. Implement savings plans and reserved instances. Target forty percent cost reduction via Episode 9 strategies.

Month four, observability refinement. Build unified dashboards from Episode 7. Cross-region error rate tracking. Replication lag alerts. Cost anomaly detection. Set appropriate alert thresholds based on three months of data.

Quarterly DR drills. Schedule first GameDay exercise from Episode 12. Test complete failover end-to-end. Document what works, what breaks. Update runbooks. Repeat quarterly forever.

Real-world example of successful 90-day migration: E-commerce company, seventy-five million revenue. Followed this roadmap precisely. Week eight discovered Aurora replication lag exceeded 200ms due to large transaction volume. Spent extra week optimizing write patterns before proceeding. Day eighty-five discovered VPC endpoint misconfiguration breaking Secrets Manager. Fixed before cutover. Day ninety went live successfully. First DR drill day one hundred twenty revealed outdated runbook step. Fixed immediately. One year later: Zero unplanned outages to secondary region, three successful failovers during primary region issues, RTO averaging four minutes.

When to abort the migration.

Abort criterion one: Business case invalidated. During assessment phase, ROI calculation shows multi-region costs exceed benefit by 5x or more. From Episode 15 anti-pattern one, don't proceed out of pride. Abort and optimize single-region reliability instead.

Abort criterion two: Data layer validation fails. Aurora replication lag consistently exceeds 500ms. Promotions fail during testing. From Episode 3, this indicates underlying architectural issues. Fix before proceeding or choose different database strategy.

Abort criterion three: Cost exceeds projections by 100%. At day forty-nine, if actual costs are double projections, you've miscalculated. From Episode 15 anti-pattern five, investigate and re-baseline before proceeding to compute layer.

Abort criterion four: Team capacity insufficient. By day sixty, team is overwhelmed maintaining multi-region. Engineering velocity dropped below fifty percent. From Episode 15 anti-pattern four, complexity exceeds team maturity. Either hire platform specialists or simplify architecture.

Before we wrap up, pause and answer these questions.

Question one: At day forty-nine, your Aurora replication lag averages 180ms but spikes to 400ms during peak hours. Do you proceed to phase three?

Question two: You've reached day eighty-five. Failover testing works but takes nine minutes instead of five-minute target. Do you go live or delay?

Question three: Day thirty business review shows expected annual outage cost of five thousand but multi-region will cost sixty thousand annually. Do you continue?

Take a moment.

Answers.

Question one: Investigate before proceeding. Average 180ms is acceptable from Episode 3. But 400ms spikes during peak indicate capacity issues. Peak hours are when you're most likely to need failover. Determine root cause - write throughput, instance size, network congestion. Resolve before adding compute complexity. Go-no-go gate two: If you can't maintain sub-200ms lag during peak, you can't guarantee RPO during actual failover.

Question two: Delay and fix. Nine minutes versus five-minute target is eighty percent variance. From Episode 12, this indicates procedure issues. Likely culprits: Aurora promotion taking longer than expected, DNS propagation, auto-scaling latency. Identify which step exceeds target. Optimize before going live. Going live with known RTO miss will fail business SLA.

Question three: Abort. From Episode 15 anti-pattern one, this is twelve times over-investment. Multi-region won't pay for itself unless outage risk dramatically increases. Better alternatives: Improve single-region resilience, multi-AZ deployments, better incident response, faster backup restores. Present alternatives to business. Don't proceed with multi-region.

Let's recap what we covered.

First: 90-day roadmap in four phases. Days 1-21 assessment and foundation. Days 22-49 data layer migration. Days 50-70 compute deployment. Days 71-90 validation and cutover. Each phase has deliverables and go-no-go gates.

Second: Phase one establishes business case, architecture design, and network foundation. Don't proceed without business approval. From Episode 15, building without justification wastes money and team morale.

Third: Phase two migrates data layer. Aurora Global Database first, DynamoDB Global Tables selectively. Validate failover procedures before proceeding. Data layer must be reliable before adding compute.

Fourth: Phase three deploys compute layer. EKS clusters, applications at reduced capacity, secrets replication. Deploy but don't serve traffic. Validate health checks and connectivity.

Fifth: Phase four introduces traffic gradually. One percent, five percent, ten percent. Test failover under production-like load. Only go live when failover meets RTO. Automate DNS failover. Train team.

Sixth: Post-cutover operational maturity. Cost optimization, observability refinement, quarterly DR drills. Multi-region isn't one-and-done. Requires ongoing discipline.

Seventh: Abort criteria. If ROI doesn't make sense, if data layer won't stabilize, if costs explode, if team overwhelmed - abort and reassess. Don't proceed blindly.

Remember the course journey? Episode 1 introduced the CCC Triangle - cost, complexity, capability. Every episode since then taught you how to navigate these trade-offs. Aurora versus DynamoDB - cost and consistency trade-offs. VPC Peering versus Transit Gateway - complexity and scale trade-offs. Hot-warm versus hot-hot - cost and RTO trade-offs.

This 90-day roadmap is the synthesis. You start with business justification. You build incrementally. You validate at every phase. You test before going live. You maintain discipline post-cutover.

You've completed Multi-Region Mastery. You understand Aurora replication mechanics, DynamoDB consistency models, EKS multi-cluster patterns, network architectures, observability strategies, DNS failover, cost optimization, CAP theorem, service mesh, disaster recovery, compliance requirements, security controls, common anti-patterns, and implementation roadmaps.

You can calculate real costs including the seven-point-five times multiplier and optimize to four times. You know when to choose CP versus AP consistency. You can design for eventual consistency. You understand split-brain scenarios. You can implement proper encryption, least-privilege IAM, zero-trust networking.

Most importantly: You know multi-region is a tool, not a goal. From Episode 9, run the ROI calculation. If it makes sense, build it following this roadmap. If it doesn't, optimize single-region reliability and be honest about trade-offs.
