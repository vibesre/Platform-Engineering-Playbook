## Spaced Repetition Plan

**Concepts Reinforced**:
- All 15 previous episodes integrated into practical roadmap
- CCC Triangle applied to phasing decisions
- Cost optimization vs deadline tradeoffs

## Lesson Flow

### 1. Foundation Recall (1 min)

"You've learned the theory. Episodes 1-15 covered everything: architecture, patterns, data, networking, DNS, costs, compliance, security, anti-patterns.

Now: How do you actually execute? In 90 days. Without breaking production. Without doubling your infrastructure bill."

### 2. Learning Objectives (30 sec)

"By the end of this lesson:
- You'll have a 90-day roadmap for YOUR company
- You'll know critical path vs nice-to-have
- You'll manage stakeholder expectations
- You'll handle discovered complexity"

---

### 3. Phase 1: Foundation & Planning (Weeks 1-2) (2 min)

**Prerequisites Assessment**:
- Do you have AWS account in both regions?
- Do you have secondary region ready for infrastructure?
- Do you have Terraform/CloudFormation for IaC?
- Do you have monitoring and alerting in place?

**Decisions**:
- Which pattern: cold-standby, hot-cold, hot-warm, hot-hot?
- Which services replicate: Aurora, DynamoDB, S3?
- Compliance requirements: SEC SCI, MiFID II, crypto?

**Deliverable**: Architecture diagram, service replication matrix, compliance checklist

---

### 4. Phase 2: Data Layer (Weeks 3-4) (2 min)

**Aurora Global Database**:
"Week 3: Enable Aurora Global Database in secondary region. Test replication lag. Measure: Is <100ms acceptable?"

**DynamoDB Global Tables** (if applicable):
"Week 3-4: Enable selective Global Tables. Monitor cost. Alert if >$1K/month per table."

**S3 Replication**:
"Week 4: Configure bucket replication. Test cross-region access patterns."

**Deliverable**: Data replicated, cross-region access validated, costs measured

---

### 5. Phase 3: Networking & DNS (Weeks 5-6) (2 min)

**Transit Gateway**:
"Week 5: Deploy Transit Gateway connecting VPCs. Configure route tables. Test latency."

**Route53 Failover**:
"Week 5-6: Configure Route53 health checks. Set up failover routing. Test with curl from multiple locations."

**Global Accelerator** (if needed):
"Week 6: Deploy if hot-hot. Otherwise, skip (costs $25+/month)."

**Deliverable**: Network connected, DNS failover working, latency measured

---

### 6. Phase 4: Application Deployment (Weeks 7-9) (2 min)

**Week 7**: Deploy application to secondary region using same Kubernetes manifests. Configure service discovery.

**Week 8**: Deploy service mesh if multi-cluster needed. Otherwise, optional.

**Week 9**: End-to-end testing: Can primary and secondary serve traffic simultaneously? Does failover work?

**Deliverable**: Both regions running application, failover tested

---

### 7. Phase 5: Observability & Hardening (Weeks 10-12) (2 min)

**Week 10**: Deploy centralized logging, metrics, tracing to both regions. Verify cross-region visibility.

**Week 11**: Security hardening: encryption keys, KMS replication, audit logging.

**Week 12**: Compliance validation: SEC SCI runbooks, MiFID II data residency, immutable audit trails.

**Deliverable**: Full observability, security hardened, compliance validated

---

### 8. Critical Path vs Nice-To-Have (1 min)

**Critical Path** (must do):
- Data replication
- Network connectivity
- DNS failover
- Application deployment
- Failover testing

**Nice-To-Have** (can defer):
- Service mesh
- Cost optimization
- Advanced security hardening
- Chaos engineering

**Real Timeline**:
"Critical path: 8 weeks for most companies. With skilled team, 6 weeks. With one part-time engineer: 4 months."

---

### 9. Managing Complexity Surprises (1 min)

"What you'll find:
- Dependency you missed (Week 4: 'Oh, this service needs that service')
- Performance issues (Week 7: 'Cross-region latency unacceptable')
- Compliance gap (Week 11: 'We need immutable audit logging')

How to handle:
- Maintain 2-week buffer in schedule
- Parallelize where possible
- Escalate compliance/security blockers immediately"

---

### 10. Post-Launch (Weeks 13+) (1 min)

"After 90 days:
- Week 1-2 (13-14): Stabilization and monitoring
- Week 3+ (15+): Cost optimization, chaos engineering, advanced hardening
- Ongoing: Quarterly failover drills, security audits"

---

### 11. Mastery Checkpoint (1 min)

"Can you:
- Create 90-day roadmap for own architecture?
- Identify critical path vs nice-to-have?
- Explain why data layer comes before networking?
- Handle discovered complexity?"

---

### 12. Course Recap: The Full Journey (2 min)

**Episode 1**: Understand why multi-region costs 7.5x
**Episode 2**: Choose your pattern (hot-warm for 62%)
**Episode 3**: Deep dive data layer (Aurora Global)
**Episode 4**: Kubernetes multi-cluster
**Episode 5**: Network connectivity (Transit Gateway)
**Episode 6**: DynamoDB Global Tables
**Episode 7**: Observability at scale
**Episode 8**: DNS and failover
**Episode 9**: Cost optimization
**Episode 10**: CAP Theorem and consistency
**Episode 11**: Kubernetes patterns and service mesh
**Episode 12**: DR testing and chaos engineering
**Episode 13**: Compliance requirements
**Episode 14**: Security and encryption
**Episode 15**: Anti-patterns to avoid
**Episode 16**: Actually execute it (you are here)

"You now know more about multi-region architecture than 99% of engineers. You can explain it. You can design it. You can build it. You can troubleshoot it."

---

### 13. Final Words (30 sec)

"Multi-region isn't about building the fanciest architecture. It's about understanding tradeoffs.

Cost vs complexity vs capability. Theoretical vs actual. What regulators mandate vs what your business needs.

Use this knowledge wisely. Not every company needs multi-region. Not every application needs hot-hot. But when you do build it, you'll build it right."
