# Lesson Outline: Episode 7 - Observability at Scale: Centralized Logging and Distributed Tracing

## Metadata
**Course**: Multi-Region Platform Engineering: AWS, Kubernetes, and Aurora at Scale
**Episode**: 7 of 16
**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Episode Type**: Core Concept
**Prerequisites**: Episodes 1-6, Understanding of basic monitoring concepts, Familiarity with CloudWatch
**Template Used**: Template 2 (Core Concept Lesson)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:
1. Design centralized logging architecture that aggregates logs from multiple regions without drowning in noise
2. Implement distributed tracing with X-Ray to follow requests across regions and services
3. Build cross-region dashboards and alerts that actually help during 2 AM outages
4. Avoid the observability anti-patterns that cost teams hours during incidents

Success criteria:
- Can design log aggregation strategy for multi-region architecture
- Can trace a request path across regions using distributed tracing
- Can build actionable dashboards and alerts
- Can troubleshoot multi-region failures efficiently

## Spaced Repetition Plan

**Concepts Introduced** (will be repeated in later episodes):
- Centralized logging patterns - Will reinforce in Episode 12 (Disaster Recovery)
- Distributed tracing - Will reinforce in Episode 15 (Anti-Patterns)
- Cross-region metrics - Will reinforce in Episode 9 (Cost Management)

**Concepts Reinforced** (from previous episodes):
- Multi-region architecture from Episodes 3-6 - Show how to observe it
- EKS clusters from Episode 4 - Log collection from pods
- Network architecture from Episode 5 - Trace requests across network boundaries
- Hot-warm pattern from Episode 2 - Monitor failover events

## Lesson Flow

### 1. Recall & Connection (1-2 min)
**Active Recall**: Remember the production failure patterns from previous episodes
**Connection**: You've built the infrastructure, now you need to see what's happening

### 2. Learning Objectives (30 sec)
State what learners will master

### 3. The Observability Problem in Multi-Region (2-3 min)
**Hook**: 2 AM outage scenario - which region failed?
**Problem**: Logs scattered across regions, no unified view
**Reality**: 10 minutes to find which service failed = $50K lost revenue

### 4. Centralized Logging Architecture (3-4 min)
**CloudWatch Logs Insights**: Query across regions
**S3 Log Aggregation**: Long-term storage and analysis
**Log Structure**: What to log, what to skip
**Cost Control**: 500GB/day logs = $15K/month if not managed

### 5. Distributed Tracing with X-Ray (3-4 min)
**How X-Ray Works**: Trace IDs across service boundaries
**Cross-Region Tracing**: Following requests across regions
**Service Maps**: Visual representation of request flow
**Real Example**: Trace a checkout flow across 3 regions, 5 services

### 6. Cross-Region Dashboards and Alerting (2-3 min)
**Dashboard Design**: What to show, what to hide
**Alert Strategy**: Actionable vs noise
**Runbooks**: What to do when alerts fire
**Example**: Aurora replication lag alert with automated remediation

### 7. Common Observability Mistakes (1-2 min)
**Mistake 1**: Logging everything (cost explosion)
**Mistake 2**: Per-region dashboards (no unified view)
**Mistake 3**: Alerts without runbooks (noise)

### 8. Active Recall Moment (1 min)
Questions on log aggregation, tracing, dashboard design

### 9. Recap & Synthesis (1-2 min)
Key takeaways, connection to bigger picture

### 10. Next Episode Preview (30 sec)
Episode 8: DNS and Traffic Management
