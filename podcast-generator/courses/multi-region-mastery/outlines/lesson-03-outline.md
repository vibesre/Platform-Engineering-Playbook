## Lesson Flow

### 1. Recall & Connection (90 seconds)

**Active Recall Prompt**:
"Before we dive in, recall from Episode 2:
- What was the typical RTO for hot-warm pattern? (Answer: 5 minutes)
- What does RPO mean? (Answer: Recovery Point Objective - data loss tolerance)
- In the e-commerce example, what was the Aurora replication lag? (Answer: 1 second, 45 seconds at failure)

[PAUSE 5 seconds]"

**Connection to Today**:
"In Episode 2, I mentioned Aurora Global Database has 'one-second lag' and can promote a secondary to writer in 'ninety seconds.' Those numbers aren't magic. They come from how Aurora actually works under the hood.

Today you'll understand exactly what's happening during that replication. The six-way storage replication nobody explains. Why physical replication beats logical replication for multi-region. And most importantly - where Aurora breaks and how to design around it."

---

### 2. Learning Objectives (30 seconds)

"By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

First: Explain how Aurora's six-way replication works - the quorum model, the storage layer separation, why this matters for multi-region.

Second: Calculate expected replication lag and determine if your application can tolerate it. We're talking forty-five to eighty-five milliseconds under normal load, one to thirty seconds under stress.

Third: Know when to use Aurora Global Database versus native Postgres replication. They're not interchangeable.

Fourth: Handle split-brain scenarios - what happens when regions diverge and how to prevent data loss."

---

### 3. Concept Introduction - What Makes Aurora Different (2 minutes)

**Teaching Approach**: Contrast with traditional databases

**The Traditional Database Problem**:
"Let's start with why Aurora exists. Traditional RDS Postgres has a problem with multi-region.

You've got your primary database writing to local storage. Every transaction writes to disk. To replicate to another region, Postgres ships the write-ahead log (WAL) across the network. Then the replica applies those changes.

Problem one: You're sending entire log records across regions. High bandwidth. High latency.

Problem two: The replica has to replay those writes. CPU-intensive. Falls behind under load.

Problem three: Failover takes minutes. The replica needs to finish applying all pending WAL records before it can accept writes."

**Aurora's Radical Design**:
"Aurora rethought the entire architecture. Here's the key insight: separate compute from storage.

Your database engine (the compute) doesn't write to local disks. It writes to a distributed storage layer. That storage layer handles all replication automatically - across six storage nodes in three availability zones.

The database engine just sends redo log records to storage. Not full data pages. Just the minimal change log. Storage layer applies those changes and replicates them.

This separation is what makes multi-region possible."

**Why This Matters for Multi-Region**:
"With Aurora Global Database, you're not replicating database to database. You're replicating storage to storage. Physical block-level replication, not logical transaction replay.

Primary region writes to its six-node storage cluster. Those redo logs ship to secondary region's storage cluster. Storage applies them. Secondary region's database engine reads from its local storage.

Result: Sub-second replication lag. Fast failover. No CPU overhead on the secondary."

---

### 4. How Aurora's Six-Way Replication Works (4 minutes)

**Teaching Approach**: Layer-by-layer explanation with quorum math

**The Six-Node Storage Architecture**:
"Each Aurora database writes to six storage nodes. Not servers - storage nodes. These are distributed across three availability zones in a region.

Two nodes in AZ-A. Two nodes in AZ-B. Two nodes in AZ-C.

When your application commits a transaction, Aurora writes to storage. But it doesn't wait for all six nodes. It uses a quorum."

**Quorum-Based Writes: Why 4 of 6 Matters**:
"Here's the math. For a write to be considered committed, four out of six storage nodes must acknowledge it.

Why four? Because if you lose an entire availability zone (two nodes), you still have four nodes up. Your database keeps writing.

Why not three? Because you also need to handle reads during partial failures. Aurora requires three nodes to acknowledge reads. If writes required only three, and you lost two nodes, you might read stale data that doesn't include recent writes.

Four for writes, three for reads. This is called quorum consistency. Write quorum + read quorum must be greater than total nodes. In Aurora: 4 + 3 = 7, which is greater than 6."

**What Happens During a Write**:
"Let's walk through a transaction:

Step 1: Your application executes INSERT INTO orders VALUES (...); and commits.

Step 2: Aurora's database engine generates a redo log record. This is minimal - just the change, not the entire data page.

Step 3: Database engine sends this redo log record to all six storage nodes in parallel.

Step 4: Storage nodes write the record to persistent storage (SSD).

Step 5: Four nodes acknowledge the write. As soon as Aurora receives four acknowledgments, the transaction is considered committed. The application gets success.

Step 6: The two slower nodes eventually catch up. Aurora doesn't wait for them."

**Physical vs Logical Replication**:
"This is physical replication. Aurora ships redo logs - byte-level changes to data blocks. Not SQL statements. Not logical transaction records.

Compare to Postgres native replication (logical): Primary ships SQL-level changes. Replica parses them, executes them, updates its tables. CPU-intensive.

Aurora (physical): Primary ships block-level changes. Storage applies them directly to data blocks. Much faster.

Trade-off: Physical replication requires identical storage format. You can't replicate Aurora to non-Aurora. Logical replication is more flexible but slower."

**Cross-Region Replication**:
"For Aurora Global Database, primary region's storage cluster ships redo logs to secondary region's storage cluster. This happens asynchronously - doesn't block commits in primary.

Secondary region's storage receives redo logs, applies them to its six-node cluster using the same quorum model. Secondary region's database engine reads from this replicated storage.

Typical lag: 45-85 milliseconds. That's network latency (10-20ms cross-region) plus storage apply time (35-65ms)."

---

### 5. Replication Lag Reality Check (3 minutes)

**Teaching Approach**: Concrete scenarios with numbers

**Normal Operations: 45-85ms**:
"Under normal load, Aurora Global Database replicates in forty-five to eighty-five milliseconds.

Let's break that down. US-EAST-1 to US-WEST-2: about fifteen milliseconds network latency. Storage apply time: thirty to seventy milliseconds depending on write volume.

For most applications, eighty-five milliseconds is invisible. User creates an order in the primary region, secondary region sees it a tenth of a second later. No one notices."

**Under Load: 1-30 Seconds**:
"But under heavy write load, replication lag can spike. Here's why:

High transaction volume means the secondary storage cluster is applying redo logs as fast as it can. If writes come in faster than storage can apply them, a backlog builds.

I've seen replication lag hit ten to thirty seconds during Black Friday-level traffic. The secondary is always catching up, never caught up.

What this means: If primary region fails during this lag, you lose the uncommitted data in transit. That's your RPO - the replication lag at the moment of failure."

**The Read-Your-Own-Writes Problem**:
"Here's a common failure pattern. User updates their profile in the primary region. Application redirects them to a page that reads from the secondary region (for load balancing).

If replication lag is two hundred milliseconds, user sees their old profile. They think the update failed. They update again. Race conditions.

Solution: sticky sessions. After a write, route that user's reads to the primary region for the next few seconds. Let replication catch up. Then you can send reads to secondary."

**Calculating Your Tolerance**:
"Can your application tolerate this? Ask:

One: Are my writes time-sensitive? Stock trading platform? Probably not. Blog posts? Probably yes.

Two: Do users need immediate consistency? User updates their email, then logs in with it. Immediate. User posts a comment, it shows up later. Eventual.

Three: What's my actual write volume? Ten writes per second? You're fine. Ten thousand per second? Expect lag spikes.

If you need immediate consistency across regions, Aurora Global Database isn't the answer. You need something like DynamoDB Global Tables with conflict resolution. We'll cover that in Episode 6."

---

### 6. When Aurora Global Database Breaks Down (2 minutes)

**Teaching Approach**: Failure scenarios and alternatives

**Scenario 1: High Write Throughput**:
"Aurora Global Database can handle about 200,000 writes per second in the primary region. But cross-region replication bandwidth is limited.

If you're pushing 100,000+ writes per second, replication lag will consistently be multiple seconds. At that scale, consider sharding across multiple Aurora clusters or switching to DynamoDB."

**Scenario 2: Large Transactions**:
"Aurora limits transaction size. If a single transaction modifies hundreds of megabytes of data, replication lag spikes. The secondary storage cluster takes time to apply that massive redo log batch.

Solution: Break large transactions into smaller ones. Or accept longer lag for batch operations."

**Scenario 3: Split-Brain During Failover**:
"What if network partition between regions during failover? Primary region thinks it's still primary, keeps accepting writes. You've promoted secondary to primary, it accepts writes. Now you have two primaries.

Aurora prevents this with safeguards. When you promote secondary, it force-demotes primary. But if network is completely partitioned and you force a manual failover, you can create split-brain.

Prevention: Always use Aurora's managed failover. Don't manually promote unless you're absolutely certain primary is dead."

**Cost Reality**:
"Aurora Global Database isn't cheap. Primary region: standard Aurora costs. Secondary region: storage replication costs plus read replica costs.

For a 1TB database with moderate write load: approximately $800/month primary, $600/month secondary. Plus cross-region data transfer: $0.02/GB.

If you're writing 10GB/day across regions, that's an extra $6/month data transfer. Not huge. But at 100GB/day, you're at $60/month just for data transfer. This adds up."

### 7. Common Mistakes (90 seconds)

**Mistake 1: Assuming Zero Lag**:
"You architect for immediate consistency, assuming Aurora replication is instant. It's not. Typical lag is fifty to one hundred milliseconds. Under load, multiple seconds.

Fix: Design for eventual consistency. Use read-your-own-writes patterns. Show users 'Your changes are being replicated' messages if necessary."

**Mistake 2: Not Testing Failover Under Load**:
"You test failover with zero traffic. Works perfectly. Ninety seconds, just like AWS promised. Then production fails during peak load with ten seconds of replication lag. You lose those ten seconds of transactions.

Fix: Test failover under realistic load. Measure actual RPO. Communicate this to business stakeholders."

**Mistake 3: Confusing Aurora Global Database with Multi-Master**:
"Aurora Global Database is NOT active-active. It's active-passive. Only primary region accepts writes. Secondary is read-only until promoted.

If you try to write to secondary, it errors. Your application needs to know which region is primary and route writes there.

Fix: Use Route53 CNAME for write endpoint. Update it during failover. Applications always connect to the current primary."

---

### 8. Active Recall Moment (60 seconds)

**Retrieval Prompt**:
"Pause and answer:

Question 1: Why does Aurora use 4-of-6 quorum for writes instead of 3-of-6?

Question 2: What's typical replication lag for Aurora Global Database under normal load? Under heavy load?

Question 3: You have a photo-sharing app. Users upload a photo, then immediately see their gallery. Can you safely read gallery from the secondary region right after upload? Why or why not?

[PAUSE 5 seconds]

Answers:

1. Four-of-6 ensures that even if you lose an entire AZ (two nodes), you still have four nodes for writes. And with 3-of-6 read quorum, write quorum plus read quorum (4+3=7) is greater than total nodes (6), ensuring consistency.

2. Normal load: 45-85ms. Heavy write load: 1-30 seconds. This is network latency plus storage apply time.

3. No - not safely. With 45-85ms lag, the photo might not be replicated yet. User sees old gallery without their new photo. Solution: read from primary region for that user's session after they upload, or implement sticky sessions."

---

### 9. Recap & Integration (90 seconds)

**Key Takeaways**:

1. **Aurora separates compute from storage**: Database engine sends redo logs to six-node distributed storage. Storage handles replication using 4-of-6 write quorum.

2. **Physical replication beats logical**: Aurora ships block-level changes, not SQL transactions. Faster, lower CPU overhead. But locks you into Aurora format.

3. **Replication lag is 45-85ms normally, 1-30s under load**: Design for eventual consistency. Use read-your-own-writes patterns. Test failover under realistic load to measure actual RPO.

4. **Aurora Global Database is active-passive, not active-active**: Only primary accepts writes. Secondary is read-only. Failover promotes secondary to primary and demotes old primary.

5. **Breaks down at extreme scale or with large transactions**: Above 100K writes/second, consider sharding or DynamoDB. Huge transactions cause lag spikes.

**Connection to Previous Episodes**:
"Remember the hot-warm pattern from Episode 2? Aurora Global Database is how you implement the data layer for hot-warm. Primary region handles writes, secondary ready to promote in ninety seconds.

The five-minute RTO we calculated? One minute was Aurora promotion. The rest was DNS failover and application scaling. Now you know what's happening during that Aurora promotion - quorum shift, storage cluster coordination, write endpoint switch."

**Preview Next Episode**:
"Episode 2 showed you hot-warm patterns. Episode 3 gave you the Aurora foundation. Next up: the compute layer. Episode 4 covers Kubernetes multi-cluster architecture - EKS patterns, control plane considerations, cross-cluster networking."

---

### 10. Next Episode Preview (30 seconds)

"Next time: Episode 4 - Kubernetes Multi-Cluster Architecture: EKS Patterns and Federation.

You'll learn:
- How EKS control plane actually works (why it depends on multiple AZs)
- Multi-cluster patterns: independent clusters vs federated clusters
- Cross-cluster service discovery and why Kubernetes federation mostly failed
- The service mesh approach that actually works in production

Aurora gave you multi-region data. Kubernetes gives you multi-region compute. You need both to build real hot-warm architectures.

See you in the next lesson."
