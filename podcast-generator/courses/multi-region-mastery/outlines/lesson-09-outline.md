- Observability from Episode 7 (data transfer costs)
- ROI calculation framework from Episode 1 (applied to optimization ROI)

## Lesson Flow

### 1. Recall & Connection (1-2 min)

**Active Recall**:
"In Episode 1, we said multi-region costs 7.5x. You nodded. You accepted it. But do you actually know WHERE that 7.5x comes from?

Today you're going to break it down. And more importantly, you're going to cut it by 40-67% without breaking reliability. Your boss thinks multi-region costs 7.5x. You're going to tell them you optimized it to 2.5-3x."

### 2. Learning Objectives (30 sec)

"By the end of this lesson:
- You'll understand the actual cost structure (the four cost categories)
- You'll know seven optimization strategies and how much each saves
- You'll calculate if optimization is worth YOUR engineering time
- You'll choose between on-demand, provisioned, and reserved capacity"

### 3. The Cost Structure Nobody Explains Honestly (2 min)

**Teaching Approach**: Revelation + detailed breakdown

**The Vendor Lie**:
"AWS tells you multi-region doubles your costs. Two regions, two times infrastructure. Sounds logical. [pause] Reality: 7.5x for hot-warm, 10x for hot-hot."

**Why They Lie**:
"They're technically correct about infrastructure doubling. They're just leaving out data transfer, replication overhead, and operational complexity."

**The Four Cost Categories**:

**1. Compute Redundancy**:
"You're not just running in two regions. You need capacity in secondary to handle full production load during failover. Hot-warm means secondary runs at 20-30% capacity idle (wasted). You're paying for compute you're not using.

Example: US-EAST-1 needs 10 r6g.4xlarge instances for production. US-WEST-2 secondary needs 3 minimum for warm state. That's 13 total vs 10 = 1.3x. But during failover, secondary scales slowly (2-3 min). So keep it at 50% = 5 instances. Now 15 total vs 10 = 1.5x compute cost just from architecture."

**2. Data Transfer**:
"Cross-region data transfer: $0.02 per GB. Aurora replicating 1TB/day = $20/day = $600/month. DynamoDB replicating 500GB/day = $300/month. Application logs = $200/month. Total: $1,100/month from just moving data. Single-region: $0."

**3. Replication Overhead**:
"Aurora Global Database costs same + transfer. But DynamoDB Global Tables? You pay Write Capacity Units for every write in every region PLUS replication WCUs. Three regions = 3x writes + 2x replication = 5x WCU cost. Single-region DynamoDB: 1,000 WCU. Multi-region: 9,000 WCU. That's 9x cost for that service."

**4. Operational Complexity**:
"More sophisticated monitoring. Deployment pipelines. Testing. Senior engineer spending 20% time on multi-region ops = $30K/year opportunity cost."

**The Math**:
"Single-region: $15K/month. Multi-region breakdown:
- Compute 1.5x: $22,500
- Data transfer: +$1,100
- DynamoDB (if used): +$30,000
- Operational: +$2,500
- Total: ~$66,100 = 4.4x

Plus redundant monitoring, dashboards, tracing. Real multiplier: 7-7.5x."

### 4. Seven Optimization Strategies (4-5 min)

**Teaching Approach**: Specific techniques with quantified savings

**Strategy 1: Right-Size Secondary Capacity**
"Don't run secondary at 50% if you can autoscale fast. EKS Cluster Autoscaler scales from 20% to 80% in 90 seconds. Run at 25% normally. Compute redundancy drops from 1.5x to 1.25x. Save 25% on compute. Example: $7,500 saved monthly."

**Strategy 2: Provisioned Capacity for DynamoDB**
"On-demand costs 5x more than provisioned for steady workloads. $63K on-demand → $12K provisioned. Save $51K annually. Only use on-demand if traffic is unpredictable."

**Strategy 3: Minimize Cross-Region Data Transfer**
"Keep reads local. Service mesh with locality-aware routing (from Episode 4) keeps 90% traffic within region. 10% cross-region only for failover. Cut data transfer 90%. $1,100 → $110 monthly."

**Strategy 4: Selective Global Tables**
"Not every table needs multi-region. User sessions, shopping carts - yes. Static reference data, marketing content - no. Replicate only active-write tables. Cut DynamoDB Global Tables costs 60%."

**Strategy 5: Tiered Observability**
"Don't ship all logs cross-region. Keep debug logs local. Ship only errors/warnings central. Cut CloudWatch costs 70%. $4,000 → $1,200 monthly."

**Strategy 6: Reserved Instances & Savings Plans**
"Commit 1-3 year term for baseline capacity. RDS Reserved: 40% savings. EC2 Savings Plans: 35%. For continuous multi-region, obvious choice. $12K → $7,800 monthly baseline. $4,200 annual savings per instance type."

**Strategy 7: S3 Intelligent Tiering**
"Logs older than 30 days auto-move to infrequent access. Save 50% on old logs. $300 → $150 monthly."

**Combined Example**:
"SaaS company, hot-warm architecture starting at $112K/month:
- Strategy 1 (right-size): -$8K
- Strategy 2 (provisioned DynamoDB): -$40K
- Strategy 3 (locality routing): -$10K
- Strategy 4 (selective tables): Included in strategy 2
- Strategy 5 (tiered logs): -$2,800
- Strategy 6 (reserved instances): -$15K
- Strategy 7 (S3 tiering): -$150

New cost: $36,050/month. Savings: 67%. Still multi-region. Still 5-min RTO. Now financially sustainable."

### 5. On-Demand vs Provisioned vs Reserved (2 min)

**Teaching Approach**: Decision framework

**On-Demand**:
- Highest per-unit cost
- Perfect for unpredictable traffic
- Multi-region: Use only for secondary region with variable load

**Provisioned Capacity**:
- 50% cheaper than on-demand
- Requires accurate capacity prediction
- Multi-region: Use for primary region where traffic is steady

**Reserved Instances**:
- 35-40% cheaper than on-demand
- 1-3 year commitment
- Multi-region: Use for baseline capacity you'll always keep running

**Decision Framework**:
"For your primary region: 80% reserved instances (baseline you always run) + 20% provisioned or on-demand (for peak overflow).

For secondary region in hot-warm: 100% provisioned capacity. You know what you need (scaled version of primary), and you'll keep it running indefinitely."

### 6. Real ROI Calculation (1 min)

**Teaching Approach**: Financial decision-making

**The Question**:
"Optimization saves $75K/month but requires one engineer 3 months to implement. Is it worth it?

$75K × 12 = $900K annual savings. Engineer cost: $150K (3 months of 1 engineer). ROI: 6x. Worth it."

**Different Scenario**:
"Optimization saves $5K/month, requires 2 engineers 2 months. Engineer cost: $100K. Annual savings: $60K. ROI: 0.6x. Not worth it. Only optimize if savings exceed implementation cost significantly."

---

### 7. Common Mistakes (1 min)

**Mistake 1**: "Optimize without understanding bottleneck"
- Fix: Profile your costs first. Know which service costs most.

**Mistake 2**: "Choose on-demand because 'we might scale'"
- Fix: If multi-region, traffic is relatively predictable. Use provisioned for cost savings.

**Mistake 3**: "Ignore data transfer optimization"
- Fix: Data transfer is often the biggest cost category. Locality-aware routing pays for itself.

---

### 8. Active Recall (1 min)

**Retrieval Prompt**:
"Pause and answer:
1. Name the four cost categories in multi-region
2. If data transfer is $1,100/month and you implement locality-aware routing, how much do you save?
3. You save $60K/month by optimizing. Optimization takes 1 engineer 6 months. What's the ROI?

[PAUSE 5 seconds]

Answers:
1. Compute redundancy, data transfer, replication overhead, operational complexity
2. 90% reduction = $1,100 × 0.9 = $990 saved = $11,880/year
3. Annual savings: $60K × 12 = $720K. Engineer cost: $300K. ROI: 2.4x (worth doing)"

---

### 9. Recap & Synthesis (1-2 min)

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **7.5x cost multiplier is breakable**: It's not a law of physics, it's the result of four specific cost categories
2. **Data transfer is usually the biggest optimization target**: Locality-aware routing often saves 40%+ alone
3. **Provisioned capacity costs half of on-demand**: For predictable multi-region workloads, it's an obvious choice
4. **Reserved instances save 35-40%**: But only reserve capacity you'll run continuously
5. **Some optimization isn't worth the effort**: Calculate ROI before optimizing

**Connection to Curriculum**:
"Episode 1's 7.5x cost multiplier made multi-region seem impossible. But now you know you can cut it nearly in half with right decisions. This makes multi-region financially rational for more companies."

### 10. Next Episode Preview (30 sec)

"Next: Episode 10 - Data Consistency Models: CAP Theorem in Production.

You've optimized costs. But you made DynamoDB tradeoffs. Now we need to understand: What did you give up? Consistency, availability, or partition tolerance? And is that acceptable for your data?"
