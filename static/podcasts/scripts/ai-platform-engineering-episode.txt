Speaker 2: ...so they deployed GitHub Copilot to 2,000 developers, productivity went up 55%, everyone was happy. Then security did an audit and found developers were using ChatGPT, Claude, and twelve other AI tools they'd never heard of. All routing company code through who-knows-where.
Speaker 1: Wait, let me guess - the security team tried to block everything, developers found VPN workarounds, and now you've got an even bigger shadow IT problem?
Speaker 2: Worse. They blocked the official tools, forcing everyone to the underground options. Classic security theater backfire.
Speaker 1: That's the perfect example of what we're diving into today. Welcome to The Platform Engineering Playbook - I'm Jordan.
Speaker 2: I'm Alex. This is the show where we dissect the technologies, trends, and decisions that shape platform engineering at scale.
Speaker 1: Today we're talking about the AI platform engineering crisis that 85% of organizations are facing right now. Shadow AI, governance that actually works, AIOps that delivers real ROI, and how to build platforms that support AI workloads without losing your mind.
Speaker 2: Plus we'll unpack why the "just ban AI tools" approach fails 100% of the time, and what actually works instead.
Speaker 1: So let's start with the data, because it's pretty alarming. ManageEngine's 2024 Shadow AI report found that 85% of IT decision-makers say employees are adopting AI tools faster than they can assess them.
Speaker 2: And here's the kicker - GenAI traffic increased 890% in 2024. That's according to Palo Alto Networks analyzing data from over 7,000 global customers. This isn't a trend, it's a tsunami.
Speaker 1: But what struck me about that research is the disconnect. 93% of employees admit they're using AI tools without approval, but only 54% of IT leaders think their policies on unauthorized AI use are actually effective.
Speaker 2: Right, because the policies are usually "don't use unauthorized tools" which is about as effective as telling developers "don't Google error messages."
Speaker 1: Okay, so help me understand the actual risks here. Because I hear a lot of FUD about AI, but what's the real exposure?
Speaker 2: The New Stack did an analysis that really crystallized it for me. Shadow AI risks are highest in serverless environments, containerized workloads, and API-driven applications - basically everywhere modern apps live. Because AI services can be easily embedded without formal security reviews.
Speaker 1: So we're talking about what? Data exfiltration?
Speaker 2: Data exfiltration, compliance violations, IP leakage. But also operational chaos. I talked to a platform team last month that discovered they were spending $47,000 a month on AI API calls across 23 different services. Nobody knew about half of them.
Speaker 1: Twenty-three different services? How does that even happen?
Speaker 2: Same way you get 130 tools in your stack. Each team makes local optimization decisions. "Oh, this LLM is better at generating test data." "This one's better at documentation." Before you know it, you're running an unauthorized zoo.
Speaker 1: And this is where platform engineering comes in, right? Because the solution isn't blocking everything.
Speaker 2: Exactly. The solution is providing a blessed path that's easier than the shadow path. Which brings us to AI gateways and governance platforms.
Speaker 1: So let's talk solutions. What does good AI governance look like in 2025?
Speaker 2: The pattern that's emerging is what I call "managed chaos." You provide a central AI gateway that gives developers access to 100+ LLMs through a single API, with guardrails baked in.
Speaker 1: And the two platforms everyone's talking about are Portkey and TrueFoundry, right?
Speaker 2: Those are the leaders, yeah. Portkey is interesting because they're model-agnostic - you can route to OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source models, whatever. They've got 50+ built-in guardrails for things like PII detection, prompt injection prevention, content filtering.
Speaker 1: What about the compliance side? Because that's usually where these projects die.
Speaker 2: Portkey's got SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR compliance. But here's what's clever - they also give you observability into AI usage. So instead of finding out you have a Shadow AI problem six months later, you can see it in real-time.
Speaker 1: Okay, and TrueFoundry?
Speaker 2: TrueFoundry is taking a different approach - they're Kubernetes-native. If you're already heavily invested in K8s, they integrate more naturally into your existing platform. Sub-3ms latency overhead, built-in RBAC, works with your existing auth.
Speaker 1: So the choice is basically: Portkey if you want maximum model flexibility and SaaS convenience, TrueFoundry if you're Kubernetes-first and want more control?
Speaker 2: Pretty much. Though honestly, either one is better than the alternative of no governance at all.
Speaker 1: Right. And then you layer in policy enforcement with something like Open Policy Agent?
Speaker 2: Yes! That's actually a pattern I'm seeing work really well. The AI gateway handles model access and basic guardrails, OPA handles your business logic - "only senior engineers can use code generation in production," "all AI-generated infrastructure changes require human review," that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Makes sense. What about costs? Because I imagine these platforms aren't free.
Speaker 2: Both have free tiers, but at scale you're paying. However, the ROI is pretty clear when you consider the alternative. That team I mentioned spending $47k on unauthorized AI? They consolidated to Portkey and cut costs by 60% just by eliminating duplicate services and negotiating bulk rates.
Speaker 1: Let's switch gears to the developer productivity side, because the data here is actually pretty compelling.
Speaker 2: The GitHub research from 2024 shows AI code assistants delivering 55% faster task completion. Not 5%, not 10% - 55%. That's massive.
Speaker 1: And job satisfaction went up 60-75%, which might actually be more important for retention.
Speaker 2: Absolutely. But here's where it gets interesting - GitHub Copilot has 82% enterprise adoption among large orgs, but Claude Code is leading in overall adoption at 53%. We're already seeing the multi-tool pattern emerge.
Speaker 1: Wait, you're telling me 49% of organizations are paying for multiple AI coding tools?
Speaker 2: Yep. And that makes sense if you think about it. Copilot is great for autocomplete and boilerplate. Claude Code is better for complex reasoning and refactoring. Cursor brings its own IDE experience. Teams want the best tool for each job.
Speaker 1: But that sounds like the same tool sprawl problem we just talked about!
Speaker 2: It does, doesn't it? Though there's a difference between managed sprawl and shadow sprawl. If you're providing 2-3 approved options through a governance layer, that's controlled choice. If developers are using 12 different tools underground, that's chaos.
Speaker 1: Fair point. What about the trust issue? Because I've heard a lot of skepticism about AI-generated code quality.
Speaker 2: The Stack Overflow 2025 survey is pretty revealing here. Only 29% of developers trust AI outputs, and 66% report spending more time debugging AI-generated code than expected.
Speaker 1: That's... not great.
Speaker 2: No, but it's also honest. And this is where platform teams can add real value - by setting expectations, providing training on effective AI usage, and building feedback loops so the tools actually improve.
Speaker 1: You mentioned security earlier. What about AI-generated vulnerabilities?
Speaker 2: NYU did research showing 40% of AI-generated code can contain vulnerabilities without proper validation. So you need three layers: OPA for policy validation, human code review for anything security-critical, and automated scanning with tools like tfsec.
Speaker 1: So AI accelerates development, but you can't skip the validation steps.
Speaker 2: Exactly. Think of it like power tools - they make you faster, but you still need to measure twice and cut once.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about AIOps, because this is where I've seen some genuinely impressive results.
Speaker 2: The numbers are wild. Edwin AI by LogicMonitor - 90% reduction in alert noise, 20% boost in operational efficiency. That's not incremental improvement, that's transformational.
Speaker 1: And Hexaware's case study with Elastic AI?
Speaker 2: Team efficiency improved 50%, but here's the stat that blew my mind - false positive alerts dropped 96%. They went from 523 alerts per week to 22. That's from drinking from a firehose to actually actionable signals.
Speaker 1: How does that even work? What's the underlying tech?
Speaker 2: It's pattern recognition plus anomaly detection plus root cause analysis. The AI learns what normal looks like for your systems, filters out noise, correlates events across different services, and surfaces the stuff that actually matters.
Speaker 1: So instead of getting paged at 3am because a log volume spike that's actually just a batch job running, you get paged when there's a real incident.
Speaker 2: Exactly. And it gets better over time. The more data it sees, the more accurate it becomes. Informatica reported 50% reduction in observability costs just by eliminating false positives and optimizing alert routing.
Speaker 1: What's the catch? Because this sounds too good to be true.
Speaker 2: The catch is it requires good telemetry. If your observability data is garbage, AI can't fix that. You need proper instrumentation, consistent tagging, structured logging - all the basics have to be in place first.
Speaker 1: So it's not a silver bullet, it's an accelerator for teams that already have decent practices.
Speaker 2: Right. Though Forrester research shows organizations using AIOps typically see 20-40% reduction in unplanned downtime, which for most companies justifies the investment even if you have to clean up your observability first.
Speaker 1: Let's shift to what this means for careers, because the skill demands are changing fast.
Speaker 2: Red Hat's State of Platform Engineering report from October 2024 found that 94% of organizations say AI is either critical or important to platform engineering's future.
Speaker 1: That's basically everyone.
Speaker 2: Basically everyone. But here's the nuance - it's not "learn AI/ML" as a general skill. It's about specific intersections. Platform engineers who understand prompt engineering and can design effective AI integrations. SREs who can leverage AIOps for incident response. MLOps engineers who can build infrastructure for AI workloads.
Speaker 1: So it's not replacing existing platform engineering skills, it's augmenting them?
Speaker 2: Yes, but the market is rewarding that augmentation. Look at the salary data - engineers with AI platform experience are commanding premiums.
Speaker 1: What's the fastest way to build that experience if you're a platform engineer without AI background?
Speaker 2: Start with your own tooling. Implement AI code assistants on your team, measure the impact, learn what works. Then move to AI governance - that's a immediate need for most organizations. Then AIOps, then MLOps if your company is shipping AI features.
Speaker 1: So it's a progression - developer tools, governance, observability, infrastructure?
Speaker 2: That's the path I'm seeing work. Because each phase builds on the previous one and delivers standalone value. You're not boiling the ocean, you're solving specific problems while building AI platform competency.
Speaker 1: Alright, let's wrap with some hard-won lessons. What are the biggest mistakes you're seeing teams make with AI platform engineering?
Speaker 2: Number one: trying to block AI instead of channeling it. That never works. Number two: deploying AI tools without training. You can't just turn on Copilot and expect 55% productivity gains - people need to learn effective prompting, when to trust AI, when not to.
Speaker 1: What's number three?
Speaker 2: Ignoring the cost controls. AI APIs can get expensive fast, especially if developers are sending entire codebases as context. You need budget alerts, rate limiting, cost allocation by team - the boring FinOps stuff nobody wants to think about.
Speaker 1: Any surprises? Things that worked better than expected?
Speaker 2: Honestly, AIOps exceeded my expectations. I was skeptical about the ROI claims, but seeing 90% alert noise reduction in production is compelling. The improvement to on-call quality of life alone is worth it.
Speaker 1: And on the flip side, what's overhyped?
Speaker 2: AI-generated infrastructure as code. It's getting better, but you still need deep Terraform or Pulumi expertise to validate what the AI produces. It's not replacing platform engineers anytime soon.
Speaker 1: So use AI to accelerate your work, but don't expect it to do your job for you.
Speaker 2: Exactly. Though five years from now? We'll have this conversation again and the landscape will look totally different.
Speaker 1: So to bring this full circle - if you're a platform engineering leader dealing with Shadow AI, what's the first move?
Speaker 2: Deploy an AI gateway within the next 30 days. Portkey or TrueFoundry, doesn't matter which - just get developers a blessed path to AI that's easier than the shadow path. That buys you time to build proper governance.
Speaker 1: And if you're already past that phase?
Speaker 2: Then focus on metrics. Track adoption, measure productivity impact, quantify cost savings. Because the business case for AI platform engineering is there, but you need data to demonstrate it.
Speaker 2: The fundamentals of good engineering remain constant, even as the landscape evolves.
Speaker 1: That's what we're here for - cutting through the noise to help you make better decisions for your teams and your career.
Speaker 2: Thanks for tuning in to The Platform Engineering Playbook. Keep building thoughtfully.
Speaker 1: Until next time.
